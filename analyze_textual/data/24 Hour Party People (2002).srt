00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,196
What, Caribbean?

162
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,794
Rhyl. The Sun Centre in Rhyl.

163
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,913
Right.

164
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,959
Right.

165
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,996
l would describe it as history.

166
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,833
How could it be history?
There were only 42 people at the gig.

167
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,309
What difference does that make?
How many were at the Last Supper?

168
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,753
Er, 1 2.

169
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,796
Well, er, 1 3 including Jesus.

170
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,997
- Hi, Tony. Have you recovered?
- lt's not historically documented.

171
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:27,436
ln other words, not many. How many
were at the murder of Julius Caesar?

172
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:31,559
- l don't know, Tony, you tell me.
- Five. So shut up, then.

173
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,832
l'm Tony Wilson.
Here we are, as we are, So lt Goes.

174
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,912
On tonight's show l'll be talking to
Alice Cooper, live at the Apollo.

175
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,231
Apparently he'll be hanging a dwarf
live on stage.

176
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,357
But, first, two minutes
of the most important music...

177
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,352
..since Elvis walked into
the Sun Studios in Memphis.

178
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,954
The Sex Pistols and Anarchy ln The UK.

179
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,792
# And l am an anarchist

180
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,476
# Don't know what l want
but l know how to get it

181
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,358
# l wanna destroy the passer-by

182
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,590
# Cos l

183
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,990
# l wanna be... #

184
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:10,471
ln 1976 two or three people controlled
all the music on television.

185
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,710
And they didn't like punk.

186
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,279
So, for a year,...

187
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,113
..ifyou wanted to see the most
exciting bands in the world,...

188
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,839
..they were on a regional show
coming out ofManchester.

189
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,076
My show.

190
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,675
- (# Make Up 2 Break Up)
- ..when foundation's on my face

191
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,955
# Foundation on my face
Eye- Eye- Eye-

192
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,157
# Shadow on the cheekbones

193
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,992
# Hides the gaze of death's face

194
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:37,277
# A death's-head thrown across me

195

# Sitting, sitting, sitting

196
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,996
# Sitting out of place #

197
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,877
(# The Passenger)

198
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,394
# What does he see?

199
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,199
# He sees the bright and hollow sky

200
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,114
# He sees the stars come out tonight

201
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,839
# He sees the city's ripped backsides

202
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,073
# And all the winding ocean drive

203
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,720
# And everything was made
for you and me

204
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,839
# All of it was made for you and me

205
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:12,515
# lt just belongs to you and me

206
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,750
# Let's take a ride... #

207
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,877
- (# ln The City)
- # You make me look a fool

208

# l wanna say

209
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,834
# l wanna tell you

00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,229
# About the young ideas

# You'd better listen
now you've said your bit

212
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,952
- (# No More Heroes)
- # Whatever happened to

213
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,234
# Dear old Lenny?

00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,355
# The great Elmyra?... #

215
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,236
The Stranglers. Amazing.

216
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,276
- Class act, that.
- They're shit.

217
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,557
- They're a bunch of wankers.
- Hey. Language.

218
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,596
(# Karl Denver: Wimoweh)

219
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,875
- This is better.
- (imitates)

220
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,190
Now, this guy...

221
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,794
l fuckin' love this guy.
This guy is fantastic.

222
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,279
Listen to that voice.

223
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:00,592
# Ah-woo ee-oo-ee-oo
woo-woo-aaaayy #

224
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,399
- Listen to him.
- Looks a bit... homo, with that...

225
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,948
Nah, man, that's part of it,
the big drop-handle moustache.

226
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,996
- Oh, no, l don't know about that.
- Brilliant.

227
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,674
# (yodels) #

228
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,678
Guy with the handlebar moustache,
that is Karl Denver.

229
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,752
This is Shaun Ryder
and that one is Paul.

230
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,991
Later they become the Happy Mondays
and get Karl Denver to sing with them.

231
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:24,789
- (# Lazyitis)
- # Somebody who just loves to run

232
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,395
# One child grows up to be... #

233
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,835
We'll be hearing more
from the Happy Mondays later...

234
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:34,515
..but right now l'm getting tired
of just putting bands on television...

235
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:38,434
..so l'm about to open
a live-music venue.

236
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,078
lt's, er...

237
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,435
- lt's a bit of a dump, isn't it?
- Not Las Vegas, is it?

238
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:46,035
- Go round to the left, Tony.
- Dog shite everywhere. Disgusting.

239
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:49,556
Yeah, well, it's urban, it's exciting.
lt's exactly the place we should be.

240
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,868
(dogs bark)

241
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,155
You don't think those kids
will nick the car?

242
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,471
- They're not gonna nick the car.
- Are you sure?

243
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,120
- Right, the reason we're here...
- Margaret?

244
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,112
Because of the explosion of music
with New Wave,...

245
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,395
..there's lots of exciting
bands happening...

246
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,278
..and l just think that, culturally,
Manchester's slightly lagging behind.

247
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,670
Yeah, to get into a nightclub
you have to dress like a hairdresser.

248
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,955
- Yeah.
- The wife's a hairdresser.

249
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,553
Well, that's great...

250
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:17,632
..but some people aren't, and they've
got a right to dance and party.

251
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,075
- l'm Tonay.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

252
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,149
Sorry, this is Tony.

253
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,038
Tonay doesn't believe in,
er, television.

254
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,157
l was just saying, cos it's funny
cos, erm,... Tony's on the telly.

255
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,596
You know what l call television?
The idiot box.

256
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:33,194
- ldiot box.
- Yeah, there's a lot of rubbish on.

257
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,032
We split the door 60/40 to me.

258
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,873
The band, they get a crate of ale.
You can have Fridays. All right?

259
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,951
- OK.
- Look round while l do the till.

260
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,473
OK. Thank you.

261
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,152
Linds. Come on.

262
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,518
- lt stinks in here.
- Erm, there's a problem.

263
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,115
You never told me he was called Tony.

264
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,952
- Who?
- What's up?

265
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,110
Tony. There's two Tonys.

266
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,758
Yeah?

267
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:01,310
Well, that... that... that...
Straightaway that's a... that's...

268
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,709
Can you not see
how that's a potential problem?

269
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:07,509
He's in charge of the club, l'm in
charge of whatever it is we're doing.

270
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,955
There's two Tonys on equal pegging,
there's a confrontation.

271
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,474
- Who's Tony one, who's Tony two?
- For fuck's sake, Tony.

272
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,235
- We'll need some differentiation.
- Yeah, but he's not called Tony.

273
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,630
He's called Tonay.
You know, Don... Tonay.

274
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,756
lt's his fucking surname, Tone.

275
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,592
- ls it?
- Yeah.

276
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,238
lt's a bit grubby.

277
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,914
Yeah, l know, but we can get it
cleaned up for the nights we're in.

278
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,514
- Use your scrubbers to clean it up.
- That's worse.

279
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,591
What is worse, Tony?

280
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,398
Well...

281
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,632
Sorry to harp on about this, but that
makes him Mr Tonay and l'm just Tony.

282
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,676
- (laughs)
- What's wrong with that, Tony?

283
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,672
Well, there's a hierarchy there
straightaway: Mister.

284
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,035
Mr Tonay is more important than Tony.
''Hello, Mr Tonay.''

285
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:49,237
''Yes, Mister. No, Mister.''
And plain old Tony. ''Tony, me mate.''

286
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,117
l've got to have some credibility.

287
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,589
Why don't you just call him Don?
How about that?

288
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,035
See if he goes for that. Call him Don.

289
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,510
- Don...
- We're trying to set up a club.

290
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,512
- (dogs bark)
- What kind of music you bringing in?

291
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,830
Erm, sort of, er,... New Wave.

292
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,273
Kinda indie.

293
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,918
- lndian?-
- No, indie.

294
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,753
(spits) Don't want any of that.
Don't like that ska.

295
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,592
- OK.
- Don't want any of that.

296
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,069
A notion. l'll leave you with this:
heavy metal.

297
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:18,914
Get one of them bands in here. They
drink like the fuckin' Queen Mother.

298
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,070
- Leave you with that.
- Nice car, Don.

299
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,799
- She's thirsty.
- See you, Don-

300
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:28,598
- l think the name thing went OK.
- He heard you that time.

301
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,636
- l was gonna be a don.
- (car horn)

302
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,678
l was gonna be a Virgil till me mum
lost her bottle at the last minute.

303
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,558
- No, he means he was gonna be a don.
- l went to Cambridge.

304
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:39,029
What about a name for the club?

305
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:43,199
Call it Factory.
l like that. Bit Andy Warhol.

306
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,759
Bit LS Lowry.

307
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,912
l just saw a sign on the wall,
said ''Factory closing'',...

308
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,560
..and l thought we can have one
going ''Factory opening''.

309
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,520
- (# The Clash: Janie Jones)
- # And he'sjust like me and you

310
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,476
Mal, when you come down to me,...

311
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:00,552
..can you just make sure
you just get a glimpse of my boot?

312
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,154
Just... OK, if it gets on screen
l get a clothing allowance.

313
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,468
- OK.
- Yeah. OK.

314
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,232
# He's in love with Janie Jones,
whoa...

315
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,788
That is the Clash,
this was So lt Goes,...

316
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,394
..and, as it goes, so it went.
lt's all over.

317
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,438
lf you wanna hear good music
from now on, get off the couch...

318
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:18,957
..and go down to the Factory night
at the Russell Club every Friday.

319
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,429
Go forth and preach the gospel.
Good night.

320
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,829
# ..how he feels

321
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,876
# Pretty bad #

322
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,916
There's quite a few.

323
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,309
lf they've started letting them in,
that's a good crowd.

324
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,516
- Fucking cock-
- Wanker.

325
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,909
- That's original.
- l like your hair(-)

326
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,672
- Oh, fuck you.
- Why does he let people say that?

327
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:41,594
He doesn't care what they say
as long as they're talkin' about him.

328
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,033
You know that, Alan.

329
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,236
- Someone who likes me. Hi.
- l love you. Will you sign this?

330
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,993
- Yeah. What's your name?

331
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,954
- Oh, hello, Mark.
- Hi, Tony. All right?

332
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:56,356
Tony, l really miss your programme so
l thought, to get it back on telly...

333
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,273
Oi, oi. He don't want it to come back.

334
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:03,239
He wants it to be gone forever
so it can become a legend. Don't ya?

335
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:06,392
A man with a grasp of semiotics.
There's your answer, sweetheart.

336
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,278
- Can l get you half a lager?
- You can get me a pint.

337
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,316
Right, OK. Right.

338
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:16,038
- Wilson, you fucking cunt-
- That's original.

339
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,798
Your drink's coming.

340
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:21,518
- ls he a friend of yours?
- Yeah, he's our singer.

341
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,750
Out the way, Steve.

342
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,638
Hi, Tony Wilson. Pleased to meet you.

343
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,393
ls he gonna hit me?

344
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,472
- You're quite close to me there.
- Yeah, l know. l wanna be.

345
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,913
Why?

346
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,470
- Cos you're a cunt, mate.
- l know, l heard you the first time.

347
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:42,791
- (# You've Heard lt Before)
- # Your smile breaking my heart

348
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,950
# Taking some time out

349
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:45,995
# Away from the places

350
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,914
Got to stop him singing, Tony.

351
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,549
lt's avant-garde.
You wouldn't understand it.

352
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,995
lt's very poor. Very poor.

353
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,076
- Try and dance to that...
- lt's provocative.

354
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,196
Provocatively poor.

355
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,918
Appallingly poor.

356
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,036
# Oh, you've heard it before #

357
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,669
They're not calling you
the new George Epstein, you know.

358
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,957
- lt's Brian Epstein.
- George Epstein, Beatles manager.

359
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,110
- That's Brian Epstein, you dickhead.
- George Epstein.

360
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,395
- lt's fucking Brian Epstein.
- lt's Brian Martin.

361
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,833
lt's George Martin, you knob.

362
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,480
Brian Martin the producer,
George Epstein the, er,... manager.

363
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,516
- Come on, let's sit down.
- You're just fucking wrong.

364
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,953
(# Digital)

365
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,435
The introduction's
not usually this long.

366
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,114
l think the singer's in the toilet.

367
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,635
Where've you been, you twat?-

368
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,357

- Oh, we won't be eating, my friend.

401
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,870
When the Don's hungry, the Don eats.

402
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,313
Wahey-

403

00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,391
Alan, where is he?

408
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,596
- Where's who, babe?

409

410
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,556

413
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:24,040

Oh, aye, yeah.

419
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,635
- Mm-mm.

420
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:40,917

What are you doing, Tony?

427
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,474
- Come on in, love- Join the party.
- lt's not how it looks.

428
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,835
- Don put me up to it. He made me.
- Comin' in?

429
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,353

431
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,750

433
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:15,513
- What you doing, Tony?

436
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,475
Can you... Can you finish me off?

437
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,156
- God bless.
- See ya.

438
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:55,559
- Hello.
- Ah, posters, Tony.

439
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:58,234
You've got the posters?-
This is the fucking gig.

440
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,311
Yeah, l know.
Took ages to get the right yellow.

441
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,709
- The gig's over.
- l know.

442
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,991
That's fucking great,... actually.

443
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,116
Yeah, it's really nice.

444
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,909
lt's beautiful. But useless.
And as William Morris once said,...

445
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,309
..''Nothing useless
can be truly beautiful.''

446
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,912
- You know what?
- All right, Tone.

447
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,399
Yeah.

448
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,756
- Heather, this is Tony Wilson.
- All right, love.

449
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,990
You seen Lindsay?

450
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,116
She went off with Howard.

451
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,194
She, er...

452
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:37,193
She just caught me getting a blow job
off a hooker in the back of a van.

453
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,628
Better go and get her.

454
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,868
- (water runs)

455

456
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,869
(clears throat)

457
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,313
Excuse me.

458
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,753
(Lindsay moans)

459
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,796
- Hi, Tony.
- Hi.

460
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,955
Erm,... have you got the car keys?

461
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:12,194
- ln me bag.
- Thanks.

462
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,032
(moaning)

463
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,393
l only got a blow job.
That's full penetration.

464
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:20,552
- (louder moaning)
- See you, Howard.

465
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,596
See ya, Tony.

466
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,555
All right?

467
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,710
(moaning)

468
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,439
l definitely don't remember
this happening.

469
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,034
This is the real Howard Devoto.

470
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:35,157
He and Lindsay insisted we made clear
that this never happened.

471
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,196
But l agree with John Ford.

472
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:40,397
When you have to choose between
truth and legend, print the legend.

473
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,757
l thought their name was Warsaw.

474
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:48,196
You can't have a band called Warsaw.
You can't put that on a poster.

475
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,555
People would think
it was a holiday advert.

476
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,712
Joy Division:
do you know what that is, Mr Wilson?

477
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:57,395
lt's when the Nazis, er,...
picked out racially pure women...

478
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,799
..and, er, had sex with them.

479
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,758
Yeah, well, Joy Division,
that's us, eh?

480
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,115
- Well, it's a very Nazi name.
- So?

481
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,668
Yeah, but it's quite... cheery,
as well.

482
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,671
- You know: ''joy''.
- Yeah.

483
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:11,149
Like a... division of joy
or something.

484
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,310
- Joy.
- Joy... Division.

485
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,675
Let's all say that together.
One, two, three...

486
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,228
- Joy.
- Joy.

487
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,675
Look at that flat-bottomed valley.

488
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,398
lt wasn't always crazy
between me and Lindsay.

489
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,835
Most days we werejust
another young couple,...

490
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,480
..who wanted all the things
young couples want.

491
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:32,393
Nice house, nice car
and a couple ofkids.

492
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,711
Enjoy the walk,
cos it's just you and me.

493
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,238
Would you like a little Tony
and a little Lindsay walking around?

494
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,550
No, it'd be a nightmare.

495
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,039
- l like to be free.
- OK.

496
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:46,998
OK. All right, that's the last...
last word l'll say on the subject.

497
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:50,152
Two words: body clock.
OK? Body clock.

498
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,595
- How are you doing?
- All right?

499
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:55,353
- Hello, l'm here.
- All right, Tone?

500
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,396
That's us. That's us.

501
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:02,149
The majors are the status quo
and we're not, we're the anarchists.

502
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,437
lt's gonna be like a co-op,
we're all gonna share in the proceeds.

503
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,080
We pay for the costs and everything
and the rest of it is 50/50.

504
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,515
50 Factory,
50 per cent goes to the artist.

505
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,556
Alan's gonna be
head of business affairs.

506
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,995
lt's Red Leb, that.
Have you smelt it? Smell that.

507
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,308
Smell that.

508
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,517
l'm giving you total creative freedom.
Right?

509
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,874
lt's dead fucking simple.

510
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,076
You don't like us, you fuck off.
l don't like you, l fuck off.

511
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:26,391
l'll write you a contract saying
there's no contract in me own blood.

512
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,914
- l'll do it if you want.
- Not in his own blood-

513
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,638
- Here you are.
- l'll do it.

514
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,995
- You write it... in your own blood.
- No, don't give him the dirty knife.

515
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:36,436
ln the wo... ln the words of
the great prophet, ''l dares do owt.''

516
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:39,398
- Oh, it ain't legal, this.
- Come on.

517
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:42,313
- Oh, he's done it, he's done it-
- There you go. Real blood.

518
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,879
''l...''

519
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,712
''..Tony...''

520
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,196
How can you read that?

521
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,236
l'm not sure that'd stand up in court-

522
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,595
What more do you want? He's written
the contract in his own blood-

523
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,832
Martin?-

524
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,272
What you doing?-

525
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,316
(coughs) Recording...

526
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,193
..silence.

527
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:19,196
You're recording silence?-

528
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,475
Now l'm recording Tony fucking Wilson.

529
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,799
Erm, we want you
to produce a band for us.

530
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:30,955
Who's us?

531
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,837
Er, Factory Records.

532
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,990
Right, 50 quid an hour.

533
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:38,072
Plus l wanna be
a partner in the company.

534
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,116
See ya. (coughs)

535
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,349
- See ya.
- (coughs)

536
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:53,876
Stop, stop, stop. Stop that
horrible fucking racket, please.

537
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,951
What's wrong with it?

538
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,678
Nothing was wrong
with the drumming as such,...

539
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,830
..it's just that, erm,...

540
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,438
..people have been playing like that
for about... 20,000 years...

541
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,273
..and quite frankly, erm,...
it's boring the arse off me.

542
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:10,319
Now, let's just try something...
a lot simpler, OK?

543
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,599
Faster but slower.

544
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,956
There's logic there somewhere.

545
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,996
- (drumming)
- l know what he means.

546
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,993
Right, stop.
We got... We got a rattle.

547
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,116
We're going to have to dismantle
the whole fucking kit.

548
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,838
You what?

549
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,751
How long's that gonna fucking take?

550
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,832
l don't fucking know.
As long as it takes.

551
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,713
ls, er....

552
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,916
ls this still costing us
50 pounds an hour?

553
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,718
We're still workin', aren't we?

554
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,516
What l'd like...

555
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,189
..is to rebuild it on the roof.

556
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,358
On the roof?

557
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,556
- Yeah.
- On the actual roof of the studio?

558
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,031
Bloody hell.

559
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,270
(siren)

560
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,913
Start playing.

561
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,115
How will l know when to stop?

562
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:18,239
Don't worry about stopping. l'll send
someone out when it's time to stop.

563
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:21,869

Sorry.

00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:46,990

Fucking retard-

572
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,393
- You... You wear it very well.
- What?-

573
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,677
You wear it very well,
now play like a fucking musician.

574
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,516
Fucking prick.

575
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:09,354
- Listen to it in the car.
- lt'll sound rubbish in the car.

576
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,193
We've got to see what it sounds like
on a transistor radio.

577

(# She's Lost Control)

581
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,430
l sound like Bowie.

582
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,636
- That's good. You like Bowie.
- l hate fucking Bowie.

583
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,871
ln All The Young Dudes he sings about
how you should die when you're 25.

584
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,473
Do you know how old he is?

585
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,676
He's 30, 29, something.
He's a liar.

586
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,715
Look, it doesn't matter.

587
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:47,030
A lot of great artists produce
their best work when they're... older.

588
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,395
- You know, WB Yeats...
- l've never heard of him, mate.

589
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:53,029
Yeats is the greatest poet since
Dante. lf he'd have died at 25...

590
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,917
- l would have heard of him, Tony.
- Hang on.

591
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,036
Listen to it.
This is... This is great.

592
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,314
This is fucking excellent.

593
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,868
- Are you listening to it? lt's great.
- lt's brilliant.

594
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:04,235
lt is. lt's very good.

595
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,193
There's nothing else out there
that sounds like it.

596
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,475
- That's the best thing about it.
- lt's wonderful.

597
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,834
- You like it?
- l do.

598
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,194
l love what he's done with the drums.

599
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,035
Yeah?

# And said ''l've lost control again'' #

604
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:32,354
Joy Division were a great band
but they were Rob's band.

605
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,795
l wanted a band ofmy own.

606
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:38,395
A Certain Ratio had all the talent
and energy ofJoy Division...

607
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,675
..but better clothes.

608
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:43,115
- You look absolutely fantastic.
- You reckon?

609
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,078
- lt's great.
- We look like the Hitler Youth.

610
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:49,038
- You don't say that to Mr Wilson.
- l think you look more like Scouts.

611
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,317
Have you seen our legs?
They're like fucking milk bottles.

612
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,310
l wouldn't worry about it,
although, that... that reminds me,...

613
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:58,119
..l must get some chicken drumsticks
on the way home.

614
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,395
All right... No, it's all right,
l've got it covered.

any anecdotes about town criers,...

786
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,637
..l'll say
''How is it relevant today...''

- And not just being for tourists...

- What d'you... What d'you mean?
- He's hanged himself.

792
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:51,353
He was found at his home this morning.

793
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,590
- Are you joking?
- No.

794
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,756
- l'm sorry.
- Well...

795
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,391
He's dead?

796
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:01,714
Yeah.

797
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,755
What a stupid bloody bugger.

798
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:14,076
Sorry about this, mate.

799

Oyez/

814
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:02,317
lf you listen to lan's music
and you know he killed himself,...

815
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:06,393
..then you probably imagine
some very dark, depressive figure.

816
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:09,313
A... prophet of urban decay
and alienation.

817
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:12,119
But l have
some wonderful memories of him,...

818
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:15,829
..such as the very last Factory night
at the Russell Club.

Mr Wilson.

844
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:43,232
Tony, hi.
l know this isn't a very good time...

845
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:46,392
..but l've made a tape of me
singing Joy Division songs.

846
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:49,313
- You probably need a singer...
- Don't hang about, do you?

847
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:52,915
- Tony. Can you give this to him?
- l've been practising the dance...

848
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,151
- l'll make sure he gets that.
- Yeah, but... he meant a lot to us.

849
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:57,639
- All right, mate.
- Mr Wilson-

850
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:00,678
lt's not the time for autographs
but thanks for coming...

851
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:02,432
Tony. Tony.

852
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:03,839
Michael.
Michael, what are you doing here?

853
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:07,071
l'm not here as a journalist,
l'm just... l'm mourning. l'm gutted.

854
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:09,196
Well, you... You are gonna
write about it, though?

855
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,396
- Oh, l don't think l can.
- Yes, you must. You have to.

856
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:13,789
- Come in. lt's good that you're here.

857
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,672
Aye, well...

00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:19,158
lt's good that you're here.

How you doing?

862
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:25,995
Hello. All right, mate.

863
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:29,793
- How you doing, darling?
- (whispers) Can't believe it.

864
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:32,636
Good to see you.

865
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,749
- l want you to write the book.
- Whoa-

866
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:38,070
You're the right person
in the right place. You should do it.

867
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:41,630
- lt's just so soon, Tony, it's sad.
- lt's historic. lt's historic.

868
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:43,711
Come on, this is...
this is where your book should start.

869
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,631
- Right.
- Where it should start.

870
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:47,392
All right?

871
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:51,234
- Didn't realise you were here.
- Hi, Tony. How you doing?

872
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:54,552
Er,... this is lan's gran.

Thanks for all you did.

875
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:02,117
l've seen you on the telly.
You always look so smart.

876
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:04,156
Come on, let's go and get
a cup of tea, shall we?

877
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:15,389
That is the musical equivalent
of Che Guevara.

878
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,436
l'm gonna go.

879
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:26,430

# Hunting by the rivers,
through the streets, every corner

Don't beat about the bush, Lindsay.

893
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:56,997
l'm gonna ask you a straight question
and l want a straight answer. Right?

894
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:59,150
Give me the dignity of that.

895
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:01,470
Are you leaving me?

896
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:02,913
Yes.

897
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:05,716
- (car horn)
- Bad energy around here now.

898
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:09,429
Well, what does that mean, bad energy?
What the fuck does that...?

899
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,636
Energy? You don't know what energy is.

900
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:14,632
- That is late 20th-century hokum...
- Don't say another word.

901
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:17,678
- ..masquerading... as spirituality.
- Shut up. Shut up.

902
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:23,630
Don't... Don't... Don't touch me.

903
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,830
That is the last time
you will ever touch me.

904
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:28,070
- All right.
- Ever.

905
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:32,918
No... All right, that is the last time
you will ever touch me.

906
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:38,035
l'm asking you really nicely.

907
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:40,193
Please...

908
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:43,197
Please don't leave me.

909
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:51,480
Oh, just fuck off. Go. Don't...

910
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:58,153
- Don't.
- Don't leave me.

912
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:11,153
(sighs)

913
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:15,590
Right. OK.

914
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:18,240
- Right, thank you, yes.
- (car horn)

915
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:20,072
Fuck off.

916
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:22,116
(tyres skid)

917
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:27,595
This is a low point for me,
obviously,...

918
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:28,874
..but, er,...

919
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:32,191
..l think it was Scott Fitzgerald
who said...

920
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:34,430
..''American lives
don't have second acts.''

921
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:36,909
Well,... this is Manchester.

922
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,275
We do things differently here.

923
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:44,275
This is the second act.

924
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:49,708
(both make bird noises)

925
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:59,518
Two lickle dicky birds
sitting on a wall,...

926
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:01,511
..one called Peter
and one called Paul.

927
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,556
Just like you, Louby-Lou,...

928
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:05,358
..Turkey-Lurkey...

929
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:08,557
..Goosey-Loosey, Henny-Penny.
D'you know what l mean?

930
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,232
No.

931
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:11,230
(whoops)

932
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:12,878

(# Wagner: Ride Of The Valkyries)

935
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:25,317
The history of popular music
is like a double helix, OK?

936
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:27,356
That's two waves that intertwine.

937
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:30,989
So one wave... goes like this,...
the other one goes like that,...

938
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:33,389
..so you've got two...

939
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:35,436
..waves doing that, OK?

940
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:37,715
Like, one like that and one like that.

941
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:40,394
Basically, when one musical movement's
in the descendant,...

942
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:41,754
..another one is in the ascendant.

943
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:45,435
Right now we're in a kind of
a crisscross, a kind of a hiatus,...

944
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:47,829
..but the two guys that are gonna be
on the crest of the next wave...

945
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:50,480
..are Paul and Shaun Ryder.

946
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:52,278
This is a true incident,...

947
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:54,954
..a bit like the hang-gliding,
which, remember, works on two levels.

948
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:57,235
This takes place in 1980,...

949
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:59,880
..when Shaun and Paul
put rat poison into some bread...

950
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:02,713
- ..and fed it to 3,000 pigeons.
- Rassam, rassam, rassam...

951
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:05,030
- Rick Rastardly, wing-ding,...
- (squawks)

952
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:07,236
..forever and ever, amen.

953
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:08,719
Ohhh- Here you go-

954
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:11,394
- Catch it-
- lt's down- Ohh-

955
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:12,754
Ahhh-

956
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:16,315
- (pigeons squawk)
- Whoo-

957
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:17,469
Hi-yah-

958
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:19,471
Obviously it's a reconstruction.

959
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:22,916
No... pigeons were harmed
in the making of this film.

960
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:26,352
Although there are those
that say they're pests.

961
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:28,192
Rats with wings.

962
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:30,555

Fac 51 , aka the Hacienda.

966
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:01,676
Buildings create synergy.
They're a focus for creativity.

967
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:05,958
When the Victorians built railways,
they didn't just put up Portakabins.

968
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:08,395
- Jesus Christ.
- They went to town.

969
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:10,990
Listen to the reverberations.
Lovely, isn't it?

970
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:13,355
Sound of... The sound of my voice.

971
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:16,954
Buildings change...
the way people think.

972
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:18,792
That's how it happened
in Renaissance Florence.

973
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:20,757
Yeah, but this isn't
Renaissance Florence,...

974
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:23,593
..this is... Dark Ages Manchester.

975
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:26,069
lt's like a fuckin' abattoir.

976

00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:38,036

980
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:40,429
..thought we might use them
as a souvenir or something.

981
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:43,159
Yeah. That's...
Yeah. That's all right.

982
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:45,470
lt's OK, it doesn't matter.
We don't... You know.

983
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:47,710
This will be
the number-one invitation.

984
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:49,995
They didn't hand out tickets
for the Sermon on the Mount.

985
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:52,913
People just turned up.
They knew it was a good gig.

986
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,310
So how much has come out in total
from our music budget?

987
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,038
700 grand.

You'll never see me again.

991
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:10,549
You don't deserve to see me again.

May 21st 1982.
The night the Hacienda opened.

997
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:32,912
Everyone wanted to play.:

998
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,389
..Bowie, Queen, the Stones.

999
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:38,597
l chose A Certain Ratio
because they were my band.

1000
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:40,636
And that was the point
ofthe Hacienda.

1001
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:44,156
lt was a place for people we knew,
people we could trust.

1002
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:47,869
l can't believe this.
They have totally betrayed us here.

1003
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:50,030
What a fucking joke-

1004
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:54,471
Oh, l dunno, Rob.
You know,... it might work.

1005
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:56,630
Has there ever been
a Wythenshawe jazz band?

1006
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:58,995
- No, there hasn't, thank fucking God.
- No, let me tell you, right.

1007
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:01,992
Jazz is the last refuge
of the untalented.

1008
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:06,198
Jazz musicians enjoy themselves
far more than anyone listening to 'em.

1009
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:07,952
lt's like theatre.

1010
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:10,474
lt's what you do
when you can't get a gig.

1011
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:12,471
lt's one down from Celebrity Squares.

1012
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:19,754
Excellent, well done.
Very good, very good.

1013
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:22,559
- So where... So where is everyone?
- There you go.

1014
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:24,358
- Erm...
- We had 100 on the guest list.

1015
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:27,159
You were at the Sex Pistols gig.
How many people were in the audience?

1016
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:29,800
- There was about 40.
- Right. And it was history.

1017
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:32,678
Yeah,
but there's only 30 here tonight.

1018
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:34,796
Exactly, exactly.

1019
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:36,950
The smaller the attendance,
the bigger the history.

1020
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:39,474
There were 1 2 people
at the Last Supper,...

..half a dozen at Kitty Hawk.

Erm,... l'll... l'll have a Coke,

1091

lt's great, it's just...

We need to have a rethink
of our strategy.

You know, what... whatever...
Whatever we achieve,...

1096
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:22,952
..the important thing to remember
is that you...

1097
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:26,077
..you know,
you make... wonderful music.

1098

1104
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:46,071
lt's my belief
that history is a wheel.

1105
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:49,188
''lnconstancy is my very essence''
says the wheel.

1106
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:51,316
''Rise up on my spokes if you like...

1107
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:55,075
..but don't complain when you're
cast back down into the depths.''

1108
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:58,470

but then so do the bad.''

but it's also our hope.''

1113
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:16,629
And finally, there were
sightings last night...

1114
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:18,676
of an unidentified flying object...

1115
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:21,194
..over the Little Hulton district
of Manchester.

1116
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:24,511
Apparently the aliens flew low over
the district and then disappeared,...

1117
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:26,556
..which is... kind of understandable.

1118
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:30,189
lf you're listening, spacemen,
next time you might wanna try Marple.

1119
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:32,714
Just don't land on my house.
Good night.

..and Bez was a great chemist.

1130

drug experience they've ever had?

lt's got that indie sound,
that indie guitar sound,...

1146

# And he made
his shock announcement

1185
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:49,559
4,000 years ago, the Egyptians built
the very first canal.

# ..backed down, backed off

1187
01:03:55,120 --> 01:03:57,793
The first canal in Britain
was built by the Romans:

1188
01:03:57,880 --> 01:03:59,313
..the Fosse Dyke in Lincoln.

1189

not to do this no more''

# And he made it all known

1191
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:07,752
This is the Rochdale Canal,
built in 1804,...

1192
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:10,308
..when Manchester was the greatest
industrial city in the world.

# ..palm out

1194

# And she said
''Don't know if l should''

1195
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:23,598
And their neglect mirrors the decline
of post-war industrial Britain.

1196
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:26,240
# ..at first it was a yes

Suddenly, everything came together.:

1199
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:39,359
..the music, the dancing,...

1200
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:41,829
..the drugs, the venue, the city.

1201
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:47,198
l was proved right.: Manchester
was like Renaissance Florence.

1202
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:49,953
Mike Pickering was right.:
you don't need bands in a club.

1203
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:52,315
Shaun Ryder was right.
New Order were right.

1204

We all came together.

1205
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:56,756

01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:34,473
On the cusp...
the cusp of a new... a new age.

1237
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:35,470
Mm-hm.

1238
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:38,677
What do you remember about, er,
the canals in those days?

1239
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:40,910
Very little.

1240
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,797
- Very little?
- Yeah.

1241
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:44,199
Peaceful.

1242
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:45,679
- Peaceful?
- Yes.

1243
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:48,672
l don't think... l don't think we're
gonna be able to use much of that.

1244
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:49,875
D'you want... l mean...

1245

(# Brian and Michael: Matchstalk Men
And Matchstalk Cats And Dogs)

# But Lowry didn't care much anyway

1248
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,956
- All right, Tony?
- OK?

1249
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:05,357

# And he painted matchstalk men...

1253
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:17,591
- You all right, Tony? How's it going?
- Great. Wonderful.

1254
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:18,795
Thought we'd get the kids in...

1255
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:20,154
This is in the Mondays' video?

1256
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:22,913
- Yeah, yeah, this is gonna be it.
- But that's Brian and Michael.

1257
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,718
Yeah, l know, but they've not actually
finished the single yet.

1258
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:26,836
The single was supposed to be done
two weeks ago.

1259
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:29,718
Yeah, but you know what he's like,
he's always a bit slow, the producer.

1260
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:31,358
Why, who... who's producing this?

1261
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:32,919
Martin Hannett.

1262
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,150
Oh, for fuck's sake-

1263
01:07:35,240 --> 01:07:37,231
Did you not know?

1264
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:39,515
No, l didn't know.

1265
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:41,716
Well, anyway, must crack on,
get these rehearsals done.

1266
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:43,631
These are great, the kids are great.

1267
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:45,233
- Hello.

# ''And all about... '' #

1271
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:57,397
The last time l'd seen Martin
was five years earlier.

1272
01:07:57,480 --> 01:08:00,074
The Hacienda was costing New Order
10,000 pounds a month.

1273
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:01,912
None ofus had a clue what to do.

1274
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,752
You know broccoli?

1275
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:05,831
Broccoli, the vegetable?

1276
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:07,512
Yeah.

1277
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:09,556
That was, er...

1278
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:17,352
That was invented by Cubby Broccoli,
producer of the James Bond films.

1279
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:19,908
- (laughs)
- Little-known fact. lt's true.

1280
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,592
(coughs)

1281
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:30,471
lt's a crossbred vegetable.

1282
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:32,312
- lt's half... cauliflower,...

1283
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:33,833
- ..half...
- What?

1284
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:35,672
Half, er,... something... a green...

1285
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:37,876
Half... gr... a... a green thing.

1286
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:41,555
Half a green thing that l don't know,
half a cauliflower.

1287
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:44,108
And the Broccoli...
Cubby Broccoli's family...

1288
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:48,079
Was inventing... vegetables
before they started making movies(?)

1289
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:50,151
That's... That was...
That bankrolled the Bond films.

1290
01:08:50,240 --> 01:08:52,549
- l don't believe you, Tony.
- lt's a... That is a fact.

1291
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:53,789
l don't believe you.

1292
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:56,189
lt's a fact. Look it up, er,...
Encyclopaedia Britannica.

1293
01:08:56,280 --> 01:08:59,317
- Where am l gonna look that up?
- lt's absolute fact, that.

1294
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:02,552
Jesus-

1295
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:04,596
(laughs wheezily)

1296
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:07,038
Thanks, Martin.

1297
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:10,993

1298
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:13,036
- So are we.
- Hi, guys.

1299
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:15,270

- Where is the mad professor?

1300
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:17,954
- Try a bit?
- Fuckin' crying in there.

(microphone)
..and it's very fucking boring.

1304
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:28,438
- He's a mess. He's a fuck...
- He's been like this all day.

1305

Bez's maracas up me fucking jacksie.

1306
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:33,635
He's back in his closet.

1307
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:37,800
Hello, Hannett, you wanker.

1308
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:42,152
- Awesome...
- Hello, Wilson, wanker-

1309
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:47,671
l'm trying to get these shower of
cunts that masquerade as a band...

1310
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:49,910
..to play some fuckin' music,...

1311
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,753
..which seems to be the greatest,
most difficult thing...

1312
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:54,956
..l've ever had to do
in my fucking life.

1313
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:56,553
Take it down, Mart, sorry, come on.

1314
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:59,996
He's calmed down a lot
since l last worked with him(-)

1315
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:02,153
- Martin...
- Fuck off-

1316

Kickin' off, man. Fuck off...

1317
01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:06,795
You can't threaten me any more,
Martin.

1318
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:08,950
You're a big man
but you're out of shape.

1319
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:11,315
Although you could sit on me.

1320

what attracted me to her.

..where they do Stars ln Their Eyes,
erm, interiors of Coronation Street.

to make do with that, sweetheart.

1383
01:13:06,240 --> 01:13:08,834
So, l mean, Granada really

01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:15,680
- Really?
- Yeah. Yeah, that's my... my label.

1387
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:17,796
- Er,... New Order? Heard of them?
- Yeah.

1388
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:20,030
Sometimes see them at the Hacienda.
Do you know the Hacienda?

1389
01:13:20,120 --> 01:13:21,553
lt's fantastic, yeah.

1390
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:22,868
- l own that nightclub.
- Really?-

1391
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:25,520
Part-owner. lf you ever want
reduced admission, come and see me.

1392
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:27,750
Better still, you get in free
if you escort me.

1393
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:29,398
- (laughs) OK.
- l'm flirting, by the way.

1394
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:30,833
You are, yes.

1395
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:32,592
- lt's that obvious?
- (laughs)

1396
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:35,672
Don't judge. Piety is
a very unattractive quality.

1397
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:37,637
Flirting is a very natural process,...

1398
01:13:37,720 --> 01:13:39,676
..she's aware of it,
l'm being postmodern,...

1399
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:41,910
..before it was fashionable.

1400
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:48,589
- 'Ey up, Tony.
- Hi.

1401
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:51,033
Hi.

1402
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:55,200
(# Marshall Jefferson: Move Your Body)

1403
01:14:09,080 --> 01:14:10,559
(crowd roars)

1404
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:11,993
(whistles)

1405
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:16,875
Being at the Hacienda was like
being at the French Revolution.

1406
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:19,918
Bliss it was that dawn to be alive.

1407
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,355
But to be young was very heaven.

1408
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:28,993
OK, so l was nearly 40,
which isn't really young,...

1409
01:14:29,080 --> 01:14:31,036
..but these days
it isn't that old either...

1410
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:33,873
..and Yvette said
the age difference didn't bother her.

1411
01:14:35,160 --> 01:14:38,357
# Gotta have house music

1412
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:40,396
# All night long #

1413
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:43,512
(cork pops)

1414
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:46,512
- (champagne splashes)
- Oh, story of my life.

1415
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:49,034
And, by the way, we're still together.

1416
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:52,351
So, whatever you're thinking,
you're wrong.

1417
01:14:53,680 --> 01:14:56,877
D'you know,
l think that Shaun Ryder is...

1418
01:14:56,960 --> 01:15:00,669
..on par with WB Yeats...
as a... as a poet.

1419
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:03,868
- Really?
- Ab... Absolutely. Totally.

1420
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:05,473
Everyone else thinks he's an idiot.

1421
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:08,870
Shaun- Where the fuck are ya?

1422
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:11,155
We can't do anythin'
without the fuckin' singer-

1423
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:14,869
Listen, one of you fuckers
is gonna have to do it. Get busy, man.

1424
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:17,155
- l'll sing.
- Horse, man, step in, mate.

1425
01:15:17,240 --> 01:15:19,515
- Come on, you're gonna have to do it.
- All right, l'll do it.

1426
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:21,556
- (# Loose Fit)
- # Won't be no misfit

1427
01:15:21,640 --> 01:15:24,313
# ln my household today

1428
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:28,598
# Pick him all up
and send him on his way

1429
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:31,316
# Do what you're doin'

1430
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:33,630
# Say what you're sayin'

1431
01:15:34,160 --> 01:15:36,390
# Go where you're goin'

1432
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:37,390
# Think what you think

1433
01:15:37,480 --> 01:15:39,994
# Sounds good to me #

1434
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:44,836
Factory believes in artistic freedom.

1435
01:15:45,680 --> 01:15:48,752
And Shaun is an artist
but he's also an addict.

1436
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:51,752
l knew then that choosing Nathan
as the new manager ofthe Mondays...

1437
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:54,440
..was not necessarily a good idea.

1438
01:15:54,440 --> 01:15:56,829
Nathan's gonna be our new manager.

1439
01:15:56,920 --> 01:15:59,388
- l'm gonna look after them.
- And he does it very well.

1440
01:15:59,480 --> 01:16:02,313
But l wanted Shaun to be happy
so l indulged him.

1441
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:05,516
- What you doing? What you doing?
- (laughter)

1442
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:08,319
Oh, God, you're not that out of it,
are you?

1443
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:10,868
- l am not a lump of hash.
- (chuckles)

1444
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:14,396
l'm in charge of Factory Records...
l think.

1445
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:17,589
They're living legends. Here we go-

1446
01:16:17,680 --> 01:16:19,989
(# KinkyAfro)

1447
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:27,758
# None ofit

1448
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:29,432
# Got a little bit

1449
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:31,636
# Are you full ofshit?

1450
01:16:33,640 --> 01:16:35,995
# Son, l am 30

1451
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:39,554
# l only went with your mother
cos she's dirty

1452
01:16:41,160 --> 01:16:43,879
# And l don't have a decent bone in me

1453
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:48,475
# What you get
isjust what you see, yeah

1454
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:51,757
lt's an adventure. lt's the Magical
Mystery Tour, the Merry Pranksters.

1455
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:54,798
lt's like Scooby Doo, innit?
Cos they had a bus, didn't they?

1456
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:56,598
lt is a little bit like Scooby Doo.

1457
01:16:58,600 --> 01:17:01,239
Manchester became
the centre ofthe universe.:

1458
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:03,356
..the best drugs, the best clothes,...

1459
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:05,590
..the best women, the best music,...

1460
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:08,069
..the best bands, the best club.

1461
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:11,997
Suddenly everyone wanted
to be from Manchester...

1462
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:15,072
..and ifyou were a Manc,
everyone wanted a part ofyou.

1463
01:17:15,160 --> 01:17:17,833
Tone? Tone? Come in the back
for a wabosh, mate? Come on.

1464
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:19,751
lt's all right, l've eaten, thanks.

1465
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:22,716
- You're looking very beautiful.
- He owns the Hacienda.

1466
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:24,631
- l'm the big guy.
- He's the big boss.

1467
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:27,678
- Oh, yeah?
- Well, metaphorically speaking.

1468
01:17:28,160 --> 01:17:30,720
lt was like being on
a fantastic fairground ride,...

1469
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:33,758
..centrifugal forces
throwing us wider and wider,...

1470
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:37,116
..and it's all right because there's
a brilliant machine at the centre...

1471
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:38,633
..to bring us back to earth.

1472
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:41,712
That was Manchester.
That was the Hacienda.

1473
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:43,956
Now, imagine the machine breaks.

1474
01:17:44,040 --> 01:17:46,395
For a while it's even better
because you're really flying...

1475
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:48,471
..but then... you're fucked...

1476
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:50,790
..because nobody beats gravity.

1477
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:54,033
# You take ten feet back
and then stab it

1478
01:17:54,120 --> 01:17:55,394
l'm back-

1479
01:17:55,480 --> 01:17:59,314
What you doin' here? l thought you
were in... glamorous fuckin' London.

1480
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:01,550
# So sack all the needy

1481
01:18:01,640 --> 01:18:03,835
l went to interview Sir Keith Joseph.

1482
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:06,554
lt's very important.
He likes to be called Sir Keith.

1483
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:08,039
His knighthood's important to him.

1484
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:12,038
They call him the Mad Monk. That's
important at the end of the story.

1485
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:13,348
# l had to crucify somebody today

1486
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:16,000
l was supposed to get the train,
right?

1487
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:17,513
But l didn't, l drove. OK?

1488
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:19,636
So l'm driving along,
driving really well,...

1489
01:18:19,720 --> 01:18:23,952
..er, and l end up
on this fucking Pennine.

1490
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:26,960
There you go: a mobile phone.
Do you know how to work one?

1491
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:28,792
Yeah. l've used 'em before.

1492
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:31,474
And l... l make a phone call
on this mobile-phone thing.

1493
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:35,877
lt's like listening to
a fucking headache.

1494
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:43,319
And then...
l was walking along a railway line...

1495
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:45,709
..and a train goes roaring past.

1496
01:18:48,680 --> 01:18:50,477
And l climbed... onto the train.

1497
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:53,279
Whoa, whoa- You can't
come in here, son. No, no, whoa.

1498
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:54,429
(tyres screech)

1499
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:57,557
Er... l... Er...
Sorry, do you know who l am?

1500
01:18:57,640 --> 01:19:00,359
Ernie, we've got one here
don't know who he is-

1501
01:19:00,440 --> 01:19:02,112
Only kiddin' you.
Go on, Tony. Sorry. Go on.

1502
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:04,555
# Yippee yippee iy-iy ay-ay-ay #

1503
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:09,511
Anyway, it was meant to be.
Comes the hour, comes the man.

1504
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:12,592
God, fate, events conspired...

1505
01:19:12,680 --> 01:19:16,036
..to transport me to London cos
l was gonna bring down the Government.

1506
01:19:16,120 --> 01:19:19,510
OK, l was late, but it didn't matter
cos l had dynamite in my pockets.

1507
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:20,919
l knew what l was gonna do.

1508
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,434
l was gonna be nice as pie to him,
call him Sir Keith,...

1509
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:25,829
..ask him about the latest
Government policy initiative...

1510
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:27,273
..and he was gonna fall apart.

1511
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:28,873
- (car horn)
- (screams)

1512
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:33,754
Hi. Sir Keith Joseph,
my humble apologies.

1513
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:36,638
l'm Anthony, by the way.

1514
01:19:36,720 --> 01:19:39,280
(chuckles) Anth-ony.

1515
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:42,352
Er, medieval rather than classical.

1516
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:46,433
Yes, Anthony of Pa... Padua.
That's who l'm named after.

1517
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:47,999
- Saint... Saint Anthony.
- Mm-hm.

1518
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:50,150
Er, Saint Anthony. Yes, er...

1519
01:19:50,240 --> 01:19:52,435
He was a monk, funnily enough.

1520
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:54,272
Funny?

1521
01:19:54,360 --> 01:19:56,510
ln what way, funny?

1522
01:19:56,600 --> 01:19:58,033
Well, you know,...

1523
01:19:58,120 --> 01:19:59,792
..''Brother Keith.''

1524
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:00,915
You must know.

1525
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:04,950
- (pants)
- Brother? (chuckles)

1526
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:08,239
l'm not a trade unionist, Mr Wilson.

1527
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:10,959
No, no... No, but, you know,
the whole monk thing...

1528
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:12,792
(pants)

1529
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:16,190
The Mad Monk. That's...
That's what they call you, isn't it?

1530
01:20:16,280 --> 01:20:18,316
Well, you are a mad bastard.

1531
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:20,595
Did l say that out loud?

1532
01:20:20,680 --> 01:20:22,511
You know your trouble,... Tony?

1533
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:25,316
You don't know what you are.

1534
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:30,951
l fucking know what you are
but you don't know what you are.

1535
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:33,600
My curiosity's got

That was something l did know.

Timing is everything.

1542
01:20:46,160 --> 01:20:48,754
When we built the Hacienda,
it was too soon.

1543
01:20:48,840 --> 01:20:51,479
When we built the Factory office,
it was too late.

1544
01:20:51,560 --> 01:20:55,189
lt did, however, have a zinc roof,
which was very, very cool.

1545
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:58,158
Even though you could only see it
ifyou were in a helicopter.

1546
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:03,078
At last, Factory has...
a proper office.

Er, l didn't ask about the material,
l asked how much it was.

1554

lt was 30 grand... but, er...

1555

No, the shape...

For God's sake-

1571
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:07,994
There was a problem with the Hacienda.
lt never made any money.

1572
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:11,152
There were huge crowds
and a great atmosphere...

1573
01:22:11,240 --> 01:22:13,470
..but it was all fuelled by ecstasy,
not alcohol.

1574
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:15,912
And we didn't sell E at the bar.

1575
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,991
Although we did talk about it.

1576
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:19,911
We were spending money
on the building,...

1577
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:23,072
..the staff, the DJs,
the sound system...

1578
01:22:23,160 --> 01:22:26,038
..but most ofthe money
went to the drug dealers.

1579
01:22:26,120 --> 01:22:29,078
And guess what?
They didn't give the money to us.

1580
01:22:29,160 --> 01:22:32,675
They spent it on clothes, or cars,
or restaurants, or houses,...

1581
01:22:32,760 --> 01:22:34,716
..or girls, or guns.

1582
01:22:35,480 --> 01:22:37,436
Especially guns.

Drug dealers are like
any other businessmen.

1587
01:22:58,680 --> 01:23:00,910
They like to increase
their market share.

undercut each other on prices,...

All right, big fella.

- He shot him, he shot him-

1598
01:23:33,080 --> 01:23:36,117
Now, this is bad in itself
but it's also bad for business.

1599
01:23:36,200 --> 01:23:39,078
When you know someone's carrying
a gun it's hard to turn them away,...

1600
01:23:39,160 --> 01:23:42,277
..so soon there's shootings
in the club...

There was no heroin on the island.
But there was plenty ofcrack.

Every week, we sent over all the cash
we had to pay for the studio...

for drugs instead.

the stole the recording gear,...

1838
01:34:41,360 --> 01:34:44,716
There's plenty of other real people
in the film. There's Paul Ryder...

1839
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:45,869
Tony.

1840
01:34:45,960 --> 01:34:47,313
- How you doing?
- Good.

1841
01:34:47,400 --> 01:34:50,870
- Mark E Smith from the Fall.
- Are you opening this club or what?

1842
01:34:50,960 --> 01:34:53,997
- Mani from the Stone Roses.
- Where's Shaun?

1843
01:34:54,080 --> 01:34:56,548
lnspiral Carpets:
what's his name? Clint Boon.

1844
01:34:56,640 --> 01:34:58,119
That's one with a table.

1845
01:34:58,200 --> 01:34:59,918
Mike Pickering.

1846
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:01,718
Dave Haslam.

1847
01:35:01,800 --> 01:35:04,030
And, er, Vini Reilly.

1848
01:35:05,400 --> 01:35:09,109
Although this scene didn't actually
make it to the final cut.

1849
01:35:09,200 --> 01:35:12,033
l'm sure it'll be on the DVD.

1850
01:35:12,120 --> 01:35:16,159
l'm in security now, Tone.
And repossession.

1851
01:35:16,560 --> 01:35:18,516
That's where the money is.

1852
01:35:18,600 --> 01:35:20,556
Are you still keeping the pub going?

1853
01:35:20,640 --> 01:35:22,596
Oh, yeah. You got to.

1854
01:35:22,680 --> 01:35:24,636
(claps) Boys-

1855
01:35:24,720 --> 01:35:27,075
Hi, Tony? Have a listen to this.

1856
01:35:27,520 --> 01:35:29,272
# You know that love

1857
01:35:30,160 --> 01:35:32,549
# Love will tear us apart

1858
01:35:32,640 --> 01:35:33,993
- # Again
- Yeah?

1859
01:35:34,080 --> 01:35:35,832
# You know that love

1860
01:35:35,920 --> 01:35:38,878
lt's an old Joy Division song
with a soul slant.

1861
01:35:39,120 --> 01:35:41,076
- Yeah.
- l know what it is.

1862
01:35:43,320 --> 01:35:47,279
l've got a big repossession number
next week. Next Tuesday.

1863
01:35:47,360 --> 01:35:49,112
Massive.

1864
01:35:52,040 --> 01:35:54,554
Whitworth Street. Hacienda.

1865
01:35:55,960 --> 01:35:57,916
l'm saying fuck all.

1866
01:35:58,000 --> 01:35:59,752
# You know that love

1867
01:35:59,840 --> 01:36:01,956
- Yeah.
- # Love will tear us apart

1868
01:36:02,040 --> 01:36:03,996
Can you tell them l've had enough?

1869
01:36:04,080 --> 01:36:05,229
Yeah. Whoa-

1870
01:36:05,320 --> 01:36:08,949
Great. Well done, lads. Fantastic.
l'll... l'll call you.

1871
01:36:13,240 --> 01:36:15,310
What's the crack with this spread,
Tony?

1872
01:36:15,400 --> 01:36:17,960
This is sophisticated food for...
Londoners.

1873
01:36:18,040 --> 01:36:19,996
- lt's fuckin' leaves-
- For Londoners?-

1874
01:36:20,080 --> 01:36:22,958
lt's stuffed vine leaves,
they're very nice.

1875
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:25,713
- ls this what they eat down there?
- Broaden your horizons.

1876
01:36:25,800 --> 01:36:28,268
Fuckin' southern food
for southern cunts-

1877
01:36:28,360 --> 01:36:30,749
Roger. ls it Roger?
Very pleased to meet you.

1878
01:36:30,840 --> 01:36:32,990
Tony, this is Terry.

1879
01:36:33,080 --> 01:36:34,832
Nice to meet you.

1880
01:36:34,920 --> 01:36:36,876
- Can l just... see the band?
- These are the guys.

1881
01:36:36,960 --> 01:36:39,190
Roger Ames, London Records.

1882
01:36:39,280 --> 01:36:41,510
- How you doing? OK?
- No, that's Roger.

1883
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:43,875
What you've done,
l think it's brilliant, and, erm...

1884
01:36:43,960 --> 01:36:46,838
..if you don't mind me saying,
what a table-

1885
01:36:46,920 --> 01:36:49,798
And there's food on it, too,
if you'd like to help yourselves.

1886
01:36:49,880 --> 01:36:52,075
l wouldn't fuckin' eat it
if l were you, it's rabbit food.

1887
01:36:52,160 --> 01:36:55,038
We like shaggin' like 'em
but we don't wanna eat like 'em.

1888
01:36:55,120 --> 01:36:58,237
lf music be the food of deals,
why don't we, erm, eat that?

1889
01:36:58,320 --> 01:37:01,357
Absolutely.
Yvette, do you wanna do the honours?

1890
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:03,396
Terry, have you met Tony?

1891
01:37:03,480 --> 01:37:05,471
- Yeah, we said hello.
- OK, fine.

1892
01:37:05,560 --> 01:37:07,516
- (# Sunshine And Love)
- What's the tune called?

1893
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:08,749
Nice to meet you.

1894
01:37:08,840 --> 01:37:11,593
We're gonna do a cover
of Silence is Golden.

1895
01:37:12,240 --> 01:37:14,196
Terry, Terry.

1896
01:37:14,280 --> 01:37:16,510
- Turn it up-
- This is brilliant.

1897
01:37:16,600 --> 01:37:18,636
- Turn it up-
- Turn it up-

1898
01:37:18,720 --> 01:37:20,472
l like that-

1899
01:37:25,440 --> 01:37:27,396
- This is... That...
- (music stops)

1900
01:37:27,480 --> 01:37:29,630
- l was really into that.
- Play some more-

1901
01:37:29,720 --> 01:37:31,472
Let's hear some lyrics.

1902
01:37:31,560 --> 01:37:34,393
You'll hear the vocals, Roger,
when we hear the offer.

1903
01:37:34,480 --> 01:37:36,436
That's the way we do things
at Factory.

1904
01:37:36,520 --> 01:37:37,953
Shaun, where you going?

1905
01:37:38,040 --> 01:37:40,838
l'm not eating fuckin' bunny rabbit
food, l'm going for a Kentucky.

1906
01:37:40,920 --> 01:37:43,070
- Are you coming?
- See you later.

1907
01:37:43,160 --> 01:37:45,151
- We'll get you a Kentucky.
- See you later, Tone.

1908
01:37:45,240 --> 01:37:47,390
All right, mate, see you later.

1909
01:37:47,480 --> 01:37:49,596
Yvette? Just keep an eye on them.

1910
01:37:49,680 --> 01:37:53,673
So, Tony, why don't we listen
to the tune while they're out?

1911
01:37:54,280 --> 01:37:55,633
Erm...

1912
01:37:56,040 --> 01:37:57,996
Hey, Tony, come on.

1913
01:37:58,080 --> 01:38:01,629
l do understand that Shaun can be....
a bit of a handful.

1914
01:38:03,440 --> 01:38:06,477
Mm, yeah. He's a genius, though.

1915
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:08,950
Yeah, you're right, he is a genius.

1916
01:38:09,040 --> 01:38:12,032
And l've got to say,
if l owned a record label,...

1917
01:38:12,120 --> 01:38:14,270
..and l had signed Shaun to it,...

1918
01:38:15,520 --> 01:38:18,239
..then l would not be selling him on
for a fee.

1919
01:38:18,320 --> 01:38:21,357
(makes chicken noises)

1920
01:38:22,160 --> 01:38:25,118
l'm going to make you an offer.
Can l lean on this?

1921
01:38:25,200 --> 01:38:27,555
Erm, yes. You've got to be a bit...
lt's fine.

1922
01:38:27,640 --> 01:38:30,632
l'm gonna make you an offer
for the whole company.

1923
01:38:30,720 --> 01:38:32,233
OK.

1924
01:38:34,240 --> 01:38:36,231
Five million.

1925
01:38:36,320 --> 01:38:38,276
What do you want for that?

1926
01:38:38,360 --> 01:38:40,316
- What do l want?
- Yeah.

1927
01:38:40,400 --> 01:38:42,356
l want everything.

1928
01:38:42,440 --> 01:38:47,514
l want everything: the back catalogue,
this table, this food, these windows.

1929
01:38:47,600 --> 01:38:49,431
- OK.
- You want Factory?

1930
01:38:49,520 --> 01:38:50,953
Quite right.

1931
01:38:51,040 --> 01:38:54,794
(clears throat) OK.
We're very, very flattered, Roger,...

1932
01:38:54,880 --> 01:38:58,111
..terribly flattered that you think
we're worth such a princely sum,...

1933
01:38:58,200 --> 01:39:02,159
..however, what you're...
what l have to explain to you is...

1934
01:39:02,240 --> 01:39:04,800
..Factory Records
are not actually a company.

1935
01:39:04,880 --> 01:39:07,314
We are an experiment
in human nature.

1936
01:39:07,400 --> 01:39:10,551
You're labouring
under the misapprehension...

1937
01:39:10,640 --> 01:39:13,791
..that we actually have... a deal...

1938
01:39:14,600 --> 01:39:16,989
..with, er,... with our bands,...

1939
01:39:17,080 --> 01:39:20,117
..that we have any kind of a contract
at all.

1940
01:39:20,200 --> 01:39:22,794
And l'm afraid we... we don't.

1941
01:39:24,400 --> 01:39:26,960
Because that's the sum total
of the paperwork...

1942
01:39:27,040 --> 01:39:31,716
..to do with Factory Records' deal
with their various bands.

1943
01:39:31,800 --> 01:39:36,157
''The artists own all their own work,
the label owns nothing.''

1944
01:39:36,240 --> 01:39:38,674
''Our bands have the freedom.''

1945
01:39:38,760 --> 01:39:40,716
''To fuck off.''

1946
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:42,756
Oh, yeah. Quite right.

1947
01:39:42,840 --> 01:39:44,956
''..the freedom to fuck off.''

1948
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:48,798
(chuckles)
l don't have to deal with you at all.

1949
01:39:48,880 --> 01:39:53,032
Correct.
But my epitaph will be...

1950
01:39:53,120 --> 01:39:57,079
..that l... never literally
nor metaphorically...

1951
01:39:57,800 --> 01:39:59,756
..sold out.

1952
01:39:59,840 --> 01:40:02,593
l protected myself
from ever having to have the...

1953
01:40:02,680 --> 01:40:04,636
..dilemma of having to sell out...

1954
01:40:04,720 --> 01:40:07,359
..by having nothing to sell out.

1955
01:40:09,680 --> 01:40:11,636
(clears throat)

1956
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:14,956
Tony, you're fucking mad.

1957
01:40:15,040 --> 01:40:16,996
That's a point of view.

1958
01:40:19,640 --> 01:40:22,473
- (# Happy Mondays: Hallelujah)
- # Hallelujah

1959
01:40:23,160 --> 01:40:24,912
# Hallelujah

1960
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,468
Most ofall, l love Manchester.:

1961
01:40:27,560 --> 01:40:30,870
..the crumbling warehouses,
the railway arches,...

1962
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:33,155
..the cheap, abundant drugs.

1963
01:40:33,240 --> 01:40:35,196
That's what did it in the end.:

1964
01:40:35,280 --> 01:40:38,636
..not the money, not the music,
not even the guns.

1965
01:40:38,720 --> 01:40:42,952
That is my heroic flaw.:
my excess ofcivic pride.

1966
01:40:46,560 --> 01:40:48,312
(Tony) Ryan-

1967
01:40:48,400 --> 01:40:51,073
Tony Wilson, is it true
the Hacienda is closing down?

1968
01:40:51,160 --> 01:40:52,115
Yes, it is.

1969
01:40:52,200 --> 01:40:54,156
How does it feel
now it's fucked up in your face?

1970
01:40:54,240 --> 01:40:57,232
Glorious. The Hacienda is dead,
it will never grow old.

1971
01:40:57,320 --> 01:40:59,276
Unlike your good self, Tony.

1972
01:40:59,360 --> 01:41:01,590
l feel like a big dandelion cock...

1973
01:41:01,680 --> 01:41:03,079
- What?
- Clock.

1974
01:41:03,160 --> 01:41:06,470
Cock or clock, it doesn't matter,
whose seed is catching the wind,...

1975
01:41:06,560 --> 01:41:09,518
..it's gonna fly off, land,
take root and spawn...

1976
01:41:09,600 --> 01:41:12,672
..dozens, thousands
of little baby dandelions,...

1977
01:41:12,760 --> 01:41:14,830
..like the biggest ever fuck.

1978
01:41:14,920 --> 01:41:17,195
And now she wants one
so l've gotta go.

1979
01:41:18,240 --> 01:41:20,470
Come on.
l've got the horn, Ryan.

1980
01:41:20,560 --> 01:41:22,869
- (horn toots)
- l've got the horn.

1981
01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:29,272
- Tony-
- All right, love?

1982
01:41:29,360 --> 01:41:31,316
- Tony-
- Hello, mate. How you doing?

1983
01:41:31,400 --> 01:41:33,152
Thanks for coming.

1984

Vini- All right, mate. Go on in.

1985
01:41:35,280 --> 01:41:37,919

- Well done, Shaun.
- Don't mention it.

2045
01:46:03,840 --> 01:46:06,434
So it wasn't a complete waste of time?

No, l had a great time, what l can

(Tony's voice)
Tony, you did a good job.

2049
01:46:27,240 --> 01:46:29,276
Basically, you were right:

2050
01:46:29,360 --> 01:46:31,715
..Shaun is the greatest poet
since Yeats.

2051
01:46:31,800 --> 01:46:34,792
This is amazing.
Can l have it in writing?

2052
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:38,953
lt is already written in the sinews
of history and the hearts of men.

2053
01:46:39,040 --> 01:46:41,429
lt's a pity you didn't sign
the Smiths...

2054
01:46:41,520 --> 01:46:43,476
..but you were right about
Mick Hucknall.

2055
01:46:43,560 --> 01:46:45,516
His music's rubbish
and he's a ginger.

2056
01:46:46,360 --> 01:46:48,316
Vini Reilly, by the way,...

2057
01:46:48,400 --> 01:46:50,356
..is way overdue a revival.

2058
01:46:50,440 --> 01:46:52,510
You might think about
a greatest hits.

2059
01:46:52,600 --> 01:46:54,795
lt's a good idea.

2060

2065
01:47:10,160 --> 01:47:12,116
Yeah, l've just seen God.

2066
01:47:12,200 --> 01:47:14,430
- You did what?
- l've just seen God.

2067
01:47:14,520 --> 01:47:16,476
- Did you?
- Yeah.

2068
01:47:16,560 --> 01:47:18,516
What did he look like?

2069
01:47:18,760 --> 01:47:20,716
He looked like me.

2070
01:47:21,520 --> 01:47:23,476
How d'you mean?

2071
01:47:23,560 --> 01:47:25,516
He was the double of me.

2072
01:47:28,400 --> 01:47:30,356
lt's written in the Bible, isn't it?

2073
01:47:30,680 --> 01:47:32,910
God made man in his own image.

2074
01:47:34,120 --> 01:47:36,270
Yeah, but not a specific man.

2075
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:39,956
No, but...

2076
01:47:40,320 --> 01:47:43,437
..if you'd have spoken to him,
he woulda looked like you.

2077
01:47:43,520 --> 01:47:45,750
But you didn't. l did.

2078
01:47:46,960 --> 01:47:48,916
