2
00:03:52,015 --> 00:03:55,051
Do you have any idea
what they were arguing about?

3
00:03:56,144 --> 00:03:58,599
- Do you speak English?
- Yeah.

4
00:03:58,938 --> 00:04:01,725
No. I'm sorry,
my German is not very good.

5
00:04:06,445 --> 00:04:08,817
Have you ever heard
that as couples get older...

6
00:04:08,906 --> 00:04:12,191
- they lose their ability to hear each other?
- No.

7
00:04:12,743 --> 00:04:17,120
Well, supposedly, men lose their ability
to hear higher-pitched sounds...

8
00:04:17,331 --> 00:04:20,166
and women eventually
lose hearing in the low end.

9
00:04:20,334 --> 00:04:23,121
- I guess they sort of nullify each other.
- I guess.

10
00:04:23,211 --> 00:04:25,881
Nature's way of allowing couples
to grow old together...

11
00:04:25,964 --> 00:04:27,791
without killing each other.

12
00:04:29,634 --> 00:04:31,093
What are you reading?

13
00:04:32,804 --> 00:04:34,002
Yeah.

14
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:35,884
How about you?

15
00:04:53,407 --> 00:04:56,776
Look, I was thinking about going
to the lounge car sometime soon.

16
00:04:56,868 --> 00:04:59,359
- Would you like to come with me?
- Yeah.

17
00:05:00,664 --> 00:05:01,826
Okay.

18
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:23,508
How do you speak such good English?

19
00:05:23,602 --> 00:05:26,271
I went to school for a summer
in Los Angeles.

20
00:05:26,855 --> 00:05:29,097
- It's fine here?
- Yeah, this is good.

21
00:05:29,775 --> 00:05:31,851
And I spent some time in London.

22
00:05:34,029 --> 00:05:36,235
How do you speak such good English?

23
00:05:36,364 --> 00:05:38,024
Me? I'm American.

24
00:05:38,241 --> 00:05:40,814
- You're American? Are you sure?
- Yeah.

25
00:05:42,495 --> 00:05:45,449
No, I'm joking. I knew you were American.

26
00:05:45,581 --> 00:05:48,867
And of course,
you don't speak any other language, right?

27
00:05:49,001 --> 00:05:50,745
Yeah, I get it.

28
00:05:50,836 --> 00:05:54,704
I'm the crude, dumb, vulgar American
who doesn't speak any other languages...

29
00:05:54,798 --> 00:05:56,293
who has no culture, right?

30
00:05:56,383 --> 00:05:58,008
But I tried.

31
00:05:58,343 --> 00:06:02,211
I took French for four years in high school.
When I first got to Paris...

32
00:06:02,306 --> 00:06:05,924
I stood in line at the metro station.
I was practicing.

33
00:06:10,563 --> 00:06:11,939
Whatever.

34
00:06:14,734 --> 00:06:16,608
You know, and I get up there...

35
00:06:16,694 --> 00:06:19,944
and I look at this woman
and my mind goes completely blank.

36
00:06:20,031 --> 00:06:22,948
And I say,
"Listen, I need a ticket to get to..."

37
00:06:23,117 --> 00:06:24,908
You know... So anyway...

38
00:06:26,704 --> 00:06:28,412
So where are you headed?

39
00:06:28,956 --> 00:06:30,580
Well, back to Paris.

40
00:06:30,874 --> 00:06:34,824
- My classes start next week.
- You're still in school? Where do you go?

41
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,493
- Yeah, La Sorbonne, you know?
- Sure.

42
00:06:39,716 --> 00:06:41,459
You're coming from Budapest?

43
00:06:41,551 --> 00:06:44,587
- Yeah, I was visiting my grandmother.
- How is she?

44
00:06:46,514 --> 00:06:47,677
She's okay.

45
00:06:47,765 --> 00:06:49,722
- She's all right?
- She's fine.

46
00:06:50,727 --> 00:06:54,095
- How about you? Where are you going?
- I'm going to Vienna.

47
00:06:54,188 --> 00:06:55,563
Vienna? What's there?

48
00:06:55,648 --> 00:06:57,854
No idea. I'm flying out of there tomorrow.

49
00:06:57,942 --> 00:06:59,317
You're on holiday?

50
00:07:03,072 --> 00:07:05,230
I don't really know what I'm on.

51
00:07:05,324 --> 00:07:07,530
I'm just traveling around...

52
00:07:07,618 --> 00:07:10,821
I've been riding the trains
the past two, three weeks.

53
00:07:10,912 --> 00:07:13,534
You were visiting friends
or just on your own?

54
00:07:13,999 --> 00:07:17,450
- Yeah, I had a friend in Madrid, but...
- Madrid, that's nice.

55
00:07:17,544 --> 00:07:20,628
Yeah, I got one of those Eurail passes,
is what I did.

56
00:07:20,713 --> 00:07:21,911
That's great.

57
00:07:22,257 --> 00:07:26,883
So has this trip around Europe
been good for you?

58
00:07:26,969 --> 00:07:29,804
Yeah, sure. It's been... It sucked.

59
00:07:30,389 --> 00:07:31,883
What?

60
00:07:33,851 --> 00:07:36,140
It's had its... Well, I'll tell you...

61
00:07:36,228 --> 00:07:40,724
sitting for weeks on end looking out the
window has actually been kind of great.

62
00:07:42,401 --> 00:07:43,943
What do you mean?

63
00:07:44,945 --> 00:07:47,068
Well, you know, for instance...

64
00:07:47,155 --> 00:07:50,026
you have ideas
that you ordinarily wouldn't have.

65
00:07:50,492 --> 00:07:52,531
- What kind of ideas?
- Want to hear one?

66
00:07:52,619 --> 00:07:54,410
- Yeah, tell me.
- All right.

67
00:07:55,205 --> 00:07:58,490
I have this idea, okay?
For a television show.

68
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:00,908
Some friends of mine
are cable-access producers.

69
00:08:01,002 --> 00:08:03,623
Do you know what that is, cable access?

70
00:08:04,964 --> 00:08:08,249
Anybody can produce a show real cheap,
and they have to put it on.

71
00:08:08,342 --> 00:08:12,719
I have this idea for this show that'll last
24 hours a day for a year straight, right?

72
00:08:12,805 --> 00:08:16,553
What you do, is you get 365 people...

73
00:08:16,642 --> 00:08:18,599
from cities all over the world...

74
00:08:18,685 --> 00:08:21,721
to do these 24-hour documents
of real time.

75
00:08:21,813 --> 00:08:23,722
Capturing life as it's lived.

76
00:08:24,649 --> 00:08:28,148
You know, it would start
with a guy waking up in the morning...

77
00:08:28,236 --> 00:08:30,442
and taking the long shower...

78
00:08:31,114 --> 00:08:34,150
eating a little breakfast,
making a little coffee...

79
00:08:34,951 --> 00:08:36,231
reading the paper...

80
00:08:36,327 --> 00:08:38,865
Wait. All those mundane, boring things...

81
00:08:38,954 --> 00:08:41,528
everybody has to do every day
of their fucking life?

82
00:08:41,624 --> 00:08:44,079
I was going to say,
"The poetry of day-to-day life."

83
00:08:44,168 --> 00:08:47,453
But you say it the way you say it,
I'll say it the way I say it.

84
00:08:47,546 --> 00:08:49,538
- Think of it like this...
- Who's gonna watch?

85
00:08:49,631 --> 00:08:53,498
Think about it like this.
Why is it that a dog sleeping in the sun...

86
00:08:53,593 --> 00:08:55,835
is so beautiful? It is. It's beautiful.

87
00:08:55,929 --> 00:08:58,218
But a guy standing at a bank machine...

88
00:08:58,306 --> 00:09:01,342
trying to take some money out,
looks like a complete moron?

89
00:09:01,434 --> 00:09:05,099
So it's like a National Geographic
program, but on people.

90
00:09:05,646 --> 00:09:06,678
Yeah.

91
00:09:07,482 --> 00:09:08,726
What do you think?

92
00:09:08,816 --> 00:09:12,481
Yeah, I can see it. Like, 24 boring hours.

93
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:16,733
Sorry. And a three-minute sex scene
where he falls asleep right after.

94
00:09:17,616 --> 00:09:22,527
Yeah, and that would be a great episode.
People would talk about that episode.

95
00:09:23,622 --> 00:09:27,370
I mean, you and your friends
could do one in Paris if you wanted.

96
00:09:27,459 --> 00:09:32,334
I don't know. The key, the thing
that haunts me is the distribution.

97
00:09:32,422 --> 00:09:36,834
Getting the tapes from town to town,
city to city, so that the play continues...

98
00:09:36,926 --> 00:09:40,924
because it'll have to play all the time,
or else it just wouldn't work.

99
00:09:42,306 --> 00:09:43,765
Thank you.

100
00:09:44,934 --> 00:09:46,096
Thanks.

101
00:09:47,728 --> 00:09:50,515
You know what? Not service oriented.

102
00:09:51,774 --> 00:09:54,443
Just an observation about Europe.

103
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:05,451
You know, my parents
never really spoke of the possibility...

104
00:10:05,537 --> 00:10:09,119
of my falling in love
or getting married or having children.

105
00:10:10,124 --> 00:10:12,034
Even as a little girl...

106
00:10:12,126 --> 00:10:15,578
they wanted me to think
as a future career, as a...

107
00:10:15,671 --> 00:10:18,672
interior designer or lawyer
or something like that.

108
00:10:19,258 --> 00:10:21,879
I'd say to my dad, "I want to be a writer."

109
00:10:22,136 --> 00:10:23,963
And he'd say, "Journalist."

110
00:10:24,221 --> 00:10:28,764
I'd say, "I wanted to have a refuge
for stray cats." He'd say, "Veterinarian."

111
00:10:28,851 --> 00:10:32,469
I'd say, "I wanted to be an actress."
He'd say, "TV newscaster."

112
00:10:32,813 --> 00:10:34,556
It was this constant conversion...

113
00:10:34,648 --> 00:10:39,309
of my fanciful ambition into
these practical moneymaking ventures.

114
00:10:41,029 --> 00:10:44,279
I always had a pretty good
bullshit detector when I was a kid.

115
00:10:44,365 --> 00:10:46,737
I always knew
when they were lying to me.

116
00:10:46,826 --> 00:10:49,281
By the time I was in high school,
I was dead set...

117
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:53,450
on listening to what everybody thought
I should be doing with my life...

118
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:56,204
and just kind of doing the opposite.

119
00:10:56,669 --> 00:10:59,242
No one was ever mean about it. It's just...

120
00:10:59,546 --> 00:11:03,758
I could never get very excited
about other people's ambitions for my life.

121
00:11:05,135 --> 00:11:06,250
But you know what?

122
00:11:06,345 --> 00:11:09,844
If your parents never really,
fully contradict you about anything...

123
00:11:09,931 --> 00:11:12,802
and are basically nice and supportive...

124
00:11:13,476 --> 00:11:16,394
it makes it even harder
to officially complain.

125
00:11:16,479 --> 00:11:20,607
Even when they're wrong,
it's this passive-aggressive shit.

126
00:11:20,692 --> 00:11:23,229
You know what I mean? I hate it.

127
00:11:23,778 --> 00:11:25,355
I really hate it.

128
00:11:25,613 --> 00:11:27,237
Well, you know...

129
00:11:27,323 --> 00:11:30,905
despite all that kind of bullshit
that comes along with it...

130
00:11:31,702 --> 00:11:34,822
I remember childhood as this...

131
00:11:35,706 --> 00:11:38,457
magical time. I do.

132
00:11:38,542 --> 00:11:42,491
I remember when my mother
first told me about death.

133
00:11:42,921 --> 00:11:45,210
My great-grandmother had just died...

134
00:11:45,298 --> 00:11:47,836
and my whole family
had visited them in Florida.

135
00:11:47,926 --> 00:11:50,595
I was about three,
three-and-a-half years old.

136
00:11:50,678 --> 00:11:53,881
Anyway, I was in the back yard, playing...

137
00:11:53,973 --> 00:11:57,424
and my sister had just taught me
how to take the garden hose...

138
00:11:57,518 --> 00:11:59,974
and do it in such a way that...

139
00:12:00,438 --> 00:12:04,138
it sprayed into the sun
and would make a rainbow, right?

140
00:12:05,192 --> 00:12:07,185
So I was doing that...

141
00:12:07,277 --> 00:12:10,112
and through the mist,
I could see my grandmother.

142
00:12:10,197 --> 00:12:14,064
She was just standing there,
smiling at me.

143
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:17,243
And I held it there for a long time...

144
00:12:17,537 --> 00:12:19,364
and I looked at her.

145
00:12:19,456 --> 00:12:23,074
Finally, I let go of the nozzle, you know?

146
00:12:23,168 --> 00:12:26,702
Then I dropped the hose,
and she disappeared.

147
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,460
So I run back inside and tell my parents.

148
00:12:30,716 --> 00:12:35,177
And they sit me down
and give me this big crap on...

149
00:12:35,971 --> 00:12:39,803
how when people die, you never see them
again, and how I'd imagined it.

150
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:43,510
But I knew what I'd seen.
I was just glad that I saw that.

151
00:12:43,604 --> 00:12:47,304
I mean, I've never seen
anything like that since. But, I don't know.

152
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:51,811
It just kind of let me know
how ambiguous everything was.

153
00:12:51,903 --> 00:12:53,101
Even death.

154
00:12:54,739 --> 00:12:57,989
You're really lucky
you can have this attitude toward death.

155
00:12:59,994 --> 00:13:02,699
I think I'm afraid of death 24 hours a day.

156
00:13:02,997 --> 00:13:06,580
I swear. I mean,
that's why I'm in a train right now.

157
00:13:06,667 --> 00:13:09,372
I could've flown to Paris,
but I'm too scared.

158
00:13:09,462 --> 00:13:12,131
- Come on.
- I can't help it.

159
00:13:12,214 --> 00:13:15,500
I know the statistics say it's safer.
Whatever.

160
00:13:15,592 --> 00:13:18,961
When I'm in a plane, I can see it,
I can see the explosion.

161
00:13:19,054 --> 00:13:21,343
I can see me falling through the clouds.

162
00:13:21,431 --> 00:13:25,892
And I'm so scared
of those few seconds of consciousness...

163
00:13:25,977 --> 00:13:29,560
before you're gonna die,
when you know for sure you're gonna die.

164
00:13:32,275 --> 00:13:34,267
I can't stop thinking that way.

165
00:13:34,902 --> 00:13:37,572
- It's exhausting.
- Yeah, I bet.

166
00:13:38,197 --> 00:13:39,656
Really exhausting.

167
00:13:43,953 --> 00:13:46,111
- I think this is Vienna.
- Yeah.

168
00:13:47,623 --> 00:13:50,292
- You get off here, no?
- Yeah, what a drag.

169
00:13:50,876 --> 00:13:54,161
I wish I'd met you earlier.
I really like talking to you.

170
00:13:55,505 --> 00:13:56,834
Yeah, me, too.

171
00:13:57,591 --> 00:13:59,797
It was really nice to meet you.

172
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:35,207
I have an admittedly insane idea,
but if I don't ask you this, it's just...

173
00:14:35,293 --> 00:14:38,080
- It's gonna haunt me the rest of my life.
- What?

174
00:14:41,382 --> 00:14:45,795
I want to keep talking to you.
I have no idea what your situation is...

175
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:50,515
but I feel like we have
some kind of connection. Right?

176
00:14:50,766 --> 00:14:52,177
Yeah, me, too.

177
00:14:52,268 --> 00:14:55,185
Great. Listen, here's the deal.
This is what we should do.

178
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:58,058
Get off with me here in Vienna
and come check out the town.

179
00:14:58,148 --> 00:14:59,892
- What?
- Come on. It'll be fun.

180
00:14:59,983 --> 00:15:01,525
- Come on.
- What would we do?

181
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:05,275
I don't know. All I know is I have
to catch an Austrian Airlines flight...

182
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:08,697
tomorrow morning at 9:30.
I don't have the money for a hotel...

183
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:12,615
so I was just going to walk around,
and it'd be more fun if you came with me.

184
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:16,701
If I turn out to be some kind of psycho,
you just get on the next train.

185
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:19,364
All right. Think of it like this.

186
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:24,916
Jump ahead 10, 20 years, okay?
And you're married.

187
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:28,922
Only your marriage doesn't have
that same energy that it used to have.

188
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:31,050
You start to blame your husband.

189
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:34,514
You think about all those guys
you've met in your life...

190
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,182
and what might've happened
if you'd picked up with one of them.

191
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,596
Well, I'm one of those guys. That's me.

192
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:42,681
So think of this as time travel...

193
00:15:42,774 --> 00:15:46,474
from then to now to find out
what you're missing out on.

194
00:15:46,569 --> 00:15:49,274
See, what this really could be
is a gigantic favor...

195
00:15:49,364 --> 00:15:53,443
to you and your future husband to find out
that you're not missing out anything.

196
00:15:53,534 --> 00:15:56,488
I'm just as big a loser as he is,
totally unmotivated, boring.

197
00:15:56,579 --> 00:15:59,330
And you made the right choice,
and you're happy.

198
00:16:05,671 --> 00:16:07,129
Let me get my bag.

199
00:16:33,989 --> 00:16:36,741
- We should get a locker for all this.
- Okay.

200
00:16:41,246 --> 00:16:42,621
What's your name?

201
00:16:42,706 --> 00:16:44,782
My name? It's Jesse.

202
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:47,656
It's James, actually,
but everybody calls me Jesse.

203
00:16:47,752 --> 00:16:50,041
You mean, Jesse James, no?

204
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:52,537
- No, just Jesse.
- I'm Celine.

205
00:17:07,313 --> 00:17:09,685
- This is a nice bridge.
- Yeah.

206
00:17:14,528 --> 00:17:17,398
- This is kind of weird.
- This is kind of weird, isn't it?

207
00:17:17,489 --> 00:17:19,565
I mean, I feel a little awkward.

208
00:17:20,367 --> 00:17:21,909
But it's all right. Right?

209
00:17:21,993 --> 00:17:24,911
This is great. Let's go to some places.
Look at your book.

210
00:17:24,996 --> 00:17:27,285
We're in Vienna, let's go to some places.

211
00:17:27,373 --> 00:17:28,998
- Let's ask these guys.
- Okay.

212
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:30,992
Excuse me?

213
00:17:31,419 --> 00:17:34,752
- Sprechen Sïe English?
- Ja. Of course.

214
00:17:34,839 --> 00:17:37,840
- Do you speak German for a change?
- What?

215
00:17:37,925 --> 00:17:39,205
No, it was a joke.

216
00:17:39,301 --> 00:17:43,216
We just got into Vienna today,
and we're looking for something fun to do.

217
00:17:43,305 --> 00:17:45,179
Like museums, exhibitions, things...

218
00:17:45,265 --> 00:17:48,100
But museums are not that funny anymore
these days.

219
00:17:48,977 --> 00:17:51,053
They are closing right now.

220
00:17:51,355 --> 00:17:54,558
- How long are you going to be here?
- Just for tonight.

221
00:17:54,816 --> 00:17:58,066
Why did you come to Vienna?
What could you be expecting?

222
00:18:00,238 --> 00:18:01,732
We're on honeymoon.

223
00:18:02,865 --> 00:18:05,403
Yeah, she got pregnant,
we had to get married...

224
00:18:05,493 --> 00:18:07,699
I don't believe you. You're a bad liar.

225
00:18:13,626 --> 00:18:16,330
This is a play we're both in...

226
00:18:16,712 --> 00:18:19,333
- and we would like to invite you.
- You're actors?

227
00:18:19,423 --> 00:18:22,128
Not professional actors.
Part-time actors for fun.

228
00:18:22,217 --> 00:18:25,337
It's a play about a cow
and Indians searching for it.

229
00:18:25,429 --> 00:18:30,553
- There are also politicians, Mexicans...
- Russians, communists.

230
00:18:30,725 --> 00:18:34,343
- You have a real cow on stage?
- No, it's an actor in a cow costume.

231
00:18:34,437 --> 00:18:36,679
- He's the cow.
- Yes, I am the cow.

232
00:18:36,773 --> 00:18:39,809
- The cow's a bit weird.
- The cow has a disease.

233
00:18:39,901 --> 00:18:41,977
She's acting a bit strange. Like a dog.

234
00:18:42,069 --> 00:18:45,438
If someone throws a stick,
she fetches it and brings it back.

235
00:18:45,531 --> 00:18:48,900
She can smoke with hoofs and everything.

236
00:18:48,993 --> 00:18:51,947
- Great.
- As you see, there is the address.

237
00:18:52,037 --> 00:18:55,406
- It's in the second district.
- Near the Prater. You know the Prater?

238
00:18:55,499 --> 00:18:58,832
- The big Ferris wheel? We should go.
- The wheel, everybody knows...

239
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:01,374
Perhaps you can go to the Prater
before the play.

240
00:19:01,463 --> 00:19:04,084
It starts at 21:30.

241
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,958
- 21:30?
- It's at 9:30.

242
00:19:07,051 --> 00:19:08,676
- 9:30.
- Right.

243
00:19:09,179 --> 00:19:11,052
Great. What's the name of this play?

244
00:19:11,139 --> 00:19:15,350
It translates as
Brïng Me the Horns of Wïlmïngton's Cow.

245
00:19:15,434 --> 00:19:16,929
I'm Wilmington's cow.

246
00:19:17,019 --> 00:19:18,597
- All right.
- Great.

247
00:19:18,688 --> 00:19:20,063
- You'll be there?
- We'll try.

248
00:19:20,147 --> 00:19:22,056
- I'm the cow.
- You're the cow.

249
00:19:22,149 --> 00:19:23,430
Goodbye.

250
00:19:43,711 --> 00:19:46,249
- All right, I got an idea. Are you ready?
- Yeah.

251
00:19:46,339 --> 00:19:49,256
It's Q and A time. We've known each other
a little while now.

252
00:19:49,342 --> 00:19:53,209
We're stuck together, so we'll ask
each other a few direct questions.

253
00:19:53,304 --> 00:19:56,221
- All right?
- So, we ask each other questions.

254
00:19:56,307 --> 00:19:58,880
Yeah. You have to answer 100% honestly.

255
00:19:58,976 --> 00:20:00,636
- Of course.
- Okay.

256
00:20:00,811 --> 00:20:02,638
All right, first question.

257
00:20:02,896 --> 00:20:05,185
- You.
- Yes, I am going to ask you.

258
00:20:05,273 --> 00:20:09,022
Describe for me your first sexual feelings...

259
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:10,984
towards a person.

260
00:20:12,197 --> 00:20:14,522
My first sexual feelings? Oh, my God.

261
00:20:16,743 --> 00:20:18,023
I know.

262
00:20:18,411 --> 00:20:20,285
Jean-Marc Fleury.

263
00:20:21,247 --> 00:20:22,871
Jean-Marc Fleury?

264
00:20:23,249 --> 00:20:26,949
We were at this summer camp together,
and he was a swimmer.

265
00:20:27,711 --> 00:20:30,712
He had bleached-out chlorine hair
and green eyes...

266
00:20:30,798 --> 00:20:34,463
and to improve his times,
he'd shave the hair off his legs and arms.

267
00:20:34,551 --> 00:20:37,837
- That's disgusting.
- He was like this gorgeous dolphin.

268
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:40,255
My friend Emma had a big crush on him.

269
00:20:40,349 --> 00:20:43,967
So one day, I was cutting across
the field back to my room...

270
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:46,812
and he came walking up beside me.
I told him:

271
00:20:46,896 --> 00:20:50,396
"You should date Emma
because she has a big crush on you."

272
00:20:50,483 --> 00:20:52,226
He turned to me and said:

273
00:20:52,318 --> 00:20:55,652
"Well, that's too bad,
because I have a big crush on you."

274
00:20:56,531 --> 00:20:59,864
So, yeah,
it really scared the hell out of me...

275
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:02,073
because I thought he was so fine.

276
00:21:02,161 --> 00:21:06,490
Then he officially asked me out on a date.
I pretended I didn't like him.

277
00:21:08,292 --> 00:21:11,910
You know,
I was so afraid of what I might do.

278
00:21:14,423 --> 00:21:18,088
So I went to see him swim a few times
at the swimming competition.

279
00:21:18,176 --> 00:21:21,130
He was so sexy. Really.
I mean, really sexy.

280
00:21:21,221 --> 00:21:25,929
We wrote these little declarations
of love at the end of the summer...

281
00:21:26,017 --> 00:21:29,137
and promised
we would keep writing forever...

282
00:21:29,228 --> 00:21:31,980
and meet again very soon...

283
00:21:32,064 --> 00:21:34,271
- Did you?
- Of course not.

284
00:21:35,192 --> 00:21:39,854
Then this is the opportune time to tell you
that I happen to be a fantastic swimmer.

285
00:21:40,364 --> 00:21:41,562
- Really?
- Yeah.

286
00:21:42,616 --> 00:21:44,443
- I make note of that.
- Okay.

287
00:21:45,077 --> 00:21:47,746
- So it's my turn. No?
- Yes, your turn.

288
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:52,742
Have you ever been in love?

289
00:21:54,544 --> 00:21:56,620
Yes. Next question.

290
00:21:57,714 --> 00:21:59,374
- What was the...
- Wait a minute.

291
00:21:59,465 --> 00:22:01,588
- So I can give one-word answers?
- Why not?

292
00:22:01,676 --> 00:22:05,127
After I went into such private details
about my first sexual feelings.

293
00:22:05,221 --> 00:22:09,598
Those are two very different questions.
I could answer the sexual feelings thing.

294
00:22:09,683 --> 00:22:13,266
But, you know, love...
I mean, what if I asked you about love?

295
00:22:13,354 --> 00:22:17,137
I would have lied, but at least
I would have made up a great story.

296
00:22:17,483 --> 00:22:19,440
Love is a complex issue, you know?

297
00:22:19,526 --> 00:22:21,435
I mean, it's like...

298
00:22:21,528 --> 00:22:25,228
Yes, I've told somebody
that I love them before, and I've meant it.

299
00:22:25,323 --> 00:22:28,822
But was it totally unselfish, giving love?

300
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:31,318
Was it a beautiful thing? Not really.

301
00:22:31,412 --> 00:22:33,701
You know, it's like, love...

302
00:22:34,332 --> 00:22:36,159
I mean, I don't know.

303
00:22:36,501 --> 00:22:37,746
You know?

304
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,579
Yeah. I know what you mean.

305
00:22:40,671 --> 00:22:45,629
But as far as sexual feelings go
it started with an obsessive relationship...

306
00:22:45,885 --> 00:22:48,043
with Miss July, 1978.

307
00:22:48,137 --> 00:22:50,259
- You know Playboy magazine?
- I've heard of it.

308
00:22:50,347 --> 00:22:51,722
- You know Crystal?
- No.

309
00:22:51,807 --> 00:22:54,476
You don't know Crystal?
Well, I knew Crystal.

310
00:22:56,478 --> 00:22:58,470
Is it my turn now? Okay.

311
00:22:58,563 --> 00:23:01,137
Tell me something
that really pisses you off.

312
00:23:01,232 --> 00:23:04,103
- Really drives you crazy.
- Pisses me off.

313
00:23:04,194 --> 00:23:06,981
- God, everything pisses me off.
- List a couple.

314
00:23:08,072 --> 00:23:11,523
I know. I hate being told by strange men...

315
00:23:11,617 --> 00:23:13,526
strange men in the street...

316
00:23:13,619 --> 00:23:18,281
you know, to smile to make them
feel better about their boring life.

317
00:23:18,874 --> 00:23:20,072
What else?

318
00:23:20,167 --> 00:23:21,412
I hate...

319
00:23:21,794 --> 00:23:25,209
I hate that 300 kilometers from here,
there's a war going on...

320
00:23:25,297 --> 00:23:28,084
people are dying,
and nobody knows what to do about it.

321
00:23:28,175 --> 00:23:30,381
Or they don't give a shit. I don't know.

322
00:23:30,469 --> 00:23:34,336
I hate that the media's trying
to control our minds.

323
00:23:34,431 --> 00:23:36,008
- The media?
- Yeah, the media.

324
00:23:36,099 --> 00:23:39,515
It's very subtle,
but it's a new form of fascism, really.

325
00:23:41,604 --> 00:23:42,719
I hate...

326
00:23:43,398 --> 00:23:47,265
I hate when I'm in a foreign country,
especially in America, the worst...

327
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:51,902
each time I wear black or lose my temper
or say anything about anything...

328
00:23:52,114 --> 00:23:55,234
they always go,
"Oh, it's so French. It's so cute."

329
00:23:55,492 --> 00:23:58,410
I hate that. I can't stand that. Really.

330
00:23:59,997 --> 00:24:01,195
Is that all?

331
00:24:01,331 --> 00:24:03,822
Well, there's a lot of things, but...

332
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,076
- So it's my turn.
- Okay.

333
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:09,042
- You're gonna answer.
- Yes, I'll answer.

334
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:10,874
What's a problem for you?

335
00:24:11,466 --> 00:24:12,794
You, probably.

336
00:24:12,967 --> 00:24:14,082
What?

337
00:24:15,178 --> 00:24:18,095
I had a thought the other day
that kind of...

338
00:24:18,181 --> 00:24:20,054
qualifies as a problem.

339
00:24:20,141 --> 00:24:21,220
What is it?

340
00:24:21,309 --> 00:24:24,096
It was a thought I had on the train, so...

341
00:24:24,437 --> 00:24:25,895
Okay. All right.

342
00:24:26,188 --> 00:24:28,264
Do you believe in reincarnation?

343
00:24:28,607 --> 00:24:30,765
Yeah, it's interesting.

344
00:24:30,859 --> 00:24:35,272
A lot of people talk about past lives
and things like that, you know?

345
00:24:35,405 --> 00:24:38,608
Even if they don't believe in it
in some specific way...

346
00:24:38,992 --> 00:24:41,447
people have a notion
of an eternal soul, right?

347
00:24:41,536 --> 00:24:42,567
- Yeah.
- Okay.

348
00:24:42,662 --> 00:24:47,454
This is my thought: 50,000 years ago
there's not even a million people.

349
00:24:47,542 --> 00:24:51,326
Ten thousand years ago, there's, like,
two million people on the planet.

350
00:24:51,421 --> 00:24:55,584
Now there's between
five and six billion people on the planet.

351
00:24:55,675 --> 00:25:00,420
If we all have our own individual,
unique soul...

352
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:02,803
where did they all come from?

353
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:06,674
Are modern souls only a fraction
of the original souls?

354
00:25:06,768 --> 00:25:11,015
Because if they are, that represents
a 5,000 to one split of each soul...

355
00:25:11,106 --> 00:25:14,439
in just the last 50,000 years,
which is a blip in the Earth's time.

356
00:25:14,526 --> 00:25:17,942
At best, we're these tiny fractions...

357
00:25:18,321 --> 00:25:19,946
of people walking...

358
00:25:20,031 --> 00:25:24,242
Is that why we're so scattered?
Is that why we're so specialized?

359
00:25:24,327 --> 00:25:26,319
Wait a minute, I'm not sure. I don't...

360
00:25:26,412 --> 00:25:29,413
Yeah, I know.
It's a totally scattered thought.

361
00:25:30,833 --> 00:25:34,747
- Which is kind of why it makes sense.
- Yeah, I agree with you.

362
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:38,337
Let's get off this damn train.

363
00:26:14,082 --> 00:26:16,704
- This place is pretty neat.
- Yeah.

364
00:26:17,252 --> 00:26:19,410
There's even a listening booth over there.

365
00:26:23,383 --> 00:26:25,459
Have you heard of this singer?

366
00:26:27,262 --> 00:26:29,835
I think she's American.
A friend told me about her.

367
00:26:29,931 --> 00:26:32,932
Do you want to go see
if that listening booth still works?

368
00:26:33,226 --> 00:26:34,340
Yeah, okay.

369
00:28:14,113 --> 00:28:16,865
Look at this. This is beautiful.

370
00:28:23,622 --> 00:28:25,449
Quick. It's leaving.

371
00:28:49,897 --> 00:28:51,605
Look, there's a rabbit.

372
00:28:52,066 --> 00:28:53,181
Yeah.

373
00:28:54,276 --> 00:28:55,818
Hey there, rabbit.

374
00:28:57,029 --> 00:28:58,523
It's so cute.

375
00:29:00,783 --> 00:29:03,155
I visited this as a young teenager.

376
00:29:03,952 --> 00:29:06,408
It left a bigger impression on me
at that time...

377
00:29:06,496 --> 00:29:08,952
- than any of the museums we went to.
- Yeah?

378
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,832
- It's tiny.
- I know.

379
00:29:11,501 --> 00:29:13,790
There was this little old man
that talked to us.

380
00:29:13,878 --> 00:29:15,159
He was the groundskeeper.

381
00:29:15,255 --> 00:29:18,172
He explained that
most of the people are buried here...

382
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:20,795
that washed up on the bank of the Danube.

383
00:29:22,178 --> 00:29:23,802
How old are these?

384
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:26,219
Around the beginning of the century or so.

385
00:29:26,307 --> 00:29:28,264
It's called the cemetery of the no-name...

386
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:30,888
because they often didn't know
who these people were.

387
00:29:30,978 --> 00:29:33,184
Maybe a first name, that's all.

388
00:29:33,397 --> 00:29:35,354
Why were all the bodies washing up?

389
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,485
I think some were from accidents
on boats and things like that.

390
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:42,855
But most of them were suicides
that jumped in the river.

391
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:48,740
I always liked the idea of all those
unknown people lost in the world.

392
00:29:48,828 --> 00:29:51,034
When I was a little girl, I thought...

393
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:53,827
if none of your family or friends
knew you were dead...

394
00:29:53,916 --> 00:29:55,992
then it's like not really being dead.

395
00:29:56,085 --> 00:29:59,086
People can invent
the best and the worst for you.

396
00:30:02,424 --> 00:30:04,583
Here she is, I think.

397
00:30:04,718 --> 00:30:07,672
Yeah, this is the one I remember the most.

398
00:30:11,266 --> 00:30:13,508
She was only 13 when she died.

399
00:30:14,227 --> 00:30:18,770
That meant something to me, you know,
I was that age when I first saw this.

400
00:30:22,944 --> 00:30:27,238
Now I'm 10 years older,
and she's still 13, I guess.

401
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:30,408
That's funny.

402
00:30:50,387 --> 00:30:52,545
That's the Danube over there.

403
00:30:52,973 --> 00:30:55,546
- That's a river, right?
- Yeah.

404
00:31:03,816 --> 00:31:05,191
This is...

405
00:31:05,693 --> 00:31:06,973
gorgeous.

406
00:31:08,028 --> 00:31:10,021
Yeah, this is beautiful.

407
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:17,828
I mean, we got...

408
00:31:18,038 --> 00:31:19,746
We got a sunset here.

409
00:31:20,582 --> 00:31:22,907
- Yeah.
- We got the Ferris wheel.

410
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,544
It seems like...

411
00:31:27,672 --> 00:31:29,131
this would be a...

412
00:31:30,967 --> 00:31:32,130
What?

413
00:31:36,139 --> 00:31:37,301
You know...

414
00:31:42,603 --> 00:31:45,308
Are you trying to say you want to kiss me?

415
00:31:47,107 --> 00:31:48,186
Yeah?

416
00:32:54,254 --> 00:32:55,630
- But you know what?
- What?

417
00:32:55,714 --> 00:32:58,585
It doesn't matter what generation
you're born into.

418
00:32:58,675 --> 00:33:00,134
Look at my parents.

419
00:33:00,218 --> 00:33:04,430
They were angry, young May '68 people
revolting against everything.

420
00:33:04,514 --> 00:33:07,965
The government,
their conservative Catholic backgrounds.

421
00:33:08,518 --> 00:33:12,350
I was born, and my father
went on to become a successful architect.

422
00:33:12,438 --> 00:33:17,184
We traveled around the world
while he built bridges, towers and stuff.

423
00:33:17,944 --> 00:33:20,648
I mean, I really can't complain
about anything.

424
00:33:20,863 --> 00:33:23,271
They love me more
than anything in the world...

425
00:33:23,365 --> 00:33:26,283
and I've been raised
with all the freedom they fought for.

426
00:33:26,535 --> 00:33:29,370
And yet, for me now,
it's another type of fight.

427
00:33:29,747 --> 00:33:33,329
We have to deal with the same old shit,
but we can't really know...

428
00:33:33,417 --> 00:33:36,038
who or, you know, what the enemy is.

429
00:33:36,545 --> 00:33:39,000
I don't know if there really is an enemy.

430
00:33:39,089 --> 00:33:41,128
Everybody's parents fucked them up.

431
00:33:41,216 --> 00:33:44,715
Rich kids' parents gave them too much.
Poor kids', not enough.

432
00:33:45,094 --> 00:33:47,502
Too much attention, not enough attention.

433
00:33:47,597 --> 00:33:50,930
They either left them
or they taught them the wrong things.

434
00:33:51,017 --> 00:33:54,966
My parents are just two people
who didn't like each other very much...

435
00:33:55,062 --> 00:33:57,019
who decided to get married
and have a kid.

436
00:33:57,106 --> 00:33:59,644
They tried their best to be nice to me.

437
00:34:00,609 --> 00:34:02,103
Did your parents divorce?

438
00:34:02,194 --> 00:34:05,029
Yeah, finally.
They should have done it a lot sooner.

439
00:34:05,113 --> 00:34:08,233
They stuck together
for the well-being of my sister and I.

440
00:34:08,325 --> 00:34:09,867
Thank you very much.

441
00:34:10,368 --> 00:34:13,903
I remember my mother once told me,
right in front of my father...

442
00:34:13,997 --> 00:34:16,749
they were having a fight,
that he didn't want to have me.

443
00:34:16,833 --> 00:34:20,083
That he was pissed off
when he found out she was pregnant.

444
00:34:20,169 --> 00:34:23,918
That I was a big mistake.
That really shaped the way I think.

445
00:34:24,006 --> 00:34:28,086
I always saw the world as this place
where I really wasn't meant to be.

446
00:34:28,261 --> 00:34:29,459
That's so sad.

447
00:34:29,595 --> 00:34:33,046
Well, I mean,
I eventually kind of took pride in it.

448
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:35,678
You know, like my life was my own doing,
or something.

449
00:34:35,768 --> 00:34:38,389
You know,
like I was crashing the big party.

450
00:34:39,104 --> 00:34:40,812
That's the way to see it.

451
00:34:41,148 --> 00:34:44,433
My parents are still married
and I guess they're happy.

452
00:34:45,152 --> 00:34:49,149
But I think it's a healthy process to rebel
against everything that came before.

453
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:50,318
Yeah.

454
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:56,698
You know, I've been wondering lately...

455
00:34:57,205 --> 00:35:00,241
do you know anyone
who's in a happy relationship?

456
00:35:01,792 --> 00:35:04,912
Yeah, sure.
You know, I know happy couples.

457
00:35:06,088 --> 00:35:08,294
But I think they lie to each other.

458
00:35:08,924 --> 00:35:10,087
Yeah.

459
00:35:11,009 --> 00:35:13,216
People can live their whole life as a lie.

460
00:35:13,303 --> 00:35:15,675
My grandmother,
she was married to this man...

461
00:35:15,764 --> 00:35:18,800
and I always thought
she had a simply, uncomplicated love life.

462
00:35:18,892 --> 00:35:23,139
But she just confessed to me
that she spent her whole life...

463
00:35:23,229 --> 00:35:26,349
dreaming about another man
she was always in love with.

464
00:35:26,441 --> 00:35:29,525
She just accepted her fate. It's so sad.

465
00:35:29,986 --> 00:35:33,271
In the same time, I love the idea
that she had all those emotions...

466
00:35:33,364 --> 00:35:35,689
and feelings I never thought
she would have had.

467
00:35:35,783 --> 00:35:38,072
I guarantee you it was better that way.

468
00:35:38,244 --> 00:35:41,743
If she'd known him,
he'd have disappointed her eventually.

469
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:44,286
- How do you know? You don't know them.
- I know.

470
00:35:44,375 --> 00:35:47,162
People put romantic projections
on everything.

471
00:35:47,252 --> 00:35:49,624
It's not based on any kind of reality.

472
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,588
- Romantic projections?
- Yeah.

473
00:35:51,673 --> 00:35:54,045
Mr. Romantic up in the Ferris wheel?

474
00:35:54,134 --> 00:35:57,004
"Oh, kiss me. The sunset.
Oh, it's so beautiful."

475
00:35:57,095 --> 00:36:00,795
All right. Tell me about your grandmother.
What were you saying about her?

476
00:36:18,657 --> 00:36:20,235
Check these guys out.

477
00:36:20,742 --> 00:36:22,735
"Hans, I have a confession to make.

478
00:36:22,828 --> 00:36:25,532
"I'm not wearing underwear
underneath this."

479
00:36:25,622 --> 00:36:28,291
"Oh, really? Does that frighten you?"

480
00:36:34,547 --> 00:36:36,872
- Can I tell you a secret?
- Yeah.

481
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:38,748
Come here.

482
00:36:38,885 --> 00:36:40,545
- What?
- Come here.

483
00:36:54,525 --> 00:36:57,644
Look at this palm reader.
She's interesting looking.

484
00:36:57,736 --> 00:36:58,815
Yeah.

485
00:36:59,988 --> 00:37:02,740
- What?
- I just made eye contact.

486
00:37:02,824 --> 00:37:04,698
- She's not coming over here.
- She is.

487
00:37:04,784 --> 00:37:05,947
Shit.

488
00:37:09,038 --> 00:37:10,117
Oh, no.

489
00:37:10,748 --> 00:37:12,657
- You want your palm read?
- No.

490
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:14,790
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

491
00:37:15,002 --> 00:37:16,496
- Okay.
- Hello.

492
00:37:17,171 --> 00:37:18,416
Here she is.

493
00:37:28,682 --> 00:37:30,591
I want your palm read.

494
00:37:33,061 --> 00:37:34,852
Yeah. How much is it?

495
00:37:35,438 --> 00:37:39,388
- For you, 50 schillings. Okay?
- Okay.

496
00:37:46,282 --> 00:37:48,820
So you have been on a journey...

497
00:37:49,368 --> 00:37:51,740
and you're a stranger to this place.

498
00:37:52,997 --> 00:37:55,322
You are an adventurer.

499
00:37:56,125 --> 00:37:57,453
A seeker.

500
00:37:58,752 --> 00:38:00,828
An adventurer in your mind.

501
00:38:05,717 --> 00:38:08,801
You are interested
in the power of the woman.

502
00:38:09,429 --> 00:38:14,174
In the woman's deep strength
and creativity.

503
00:38:14,476 --> 00:38:16,468
You're becoming this woman.

504
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:26,147
You need to resign yourself
to the awkwardness of life.

505
00:38:27,279 --> 00:38:30,482
Only if you find peace within yourself...

506
00:38:31,325 --> 00:38:34,445
will you find true connection with others.

507
00:38:38,373 --> 00:38:40,165
That is a stranger to you?

508
00:38:40,333 --> 00:38:41,744
I guess so.

509
00:38:47,757 --> 00:38:50,248
You will be all right. He's learning.

510
00:38:51,219 --> 00:38:53,591
Okay. Money.

511
00:39:01,395 --> 00:39:04,645
You're both stars. Don't forget.

512
00:39:05,774 --> 00:39:08,811
When the stars exploded
billions of years ago...

513
00:39:08,902 --> 00:39:11,773
they formed everything that is this world.

514
00:39:12,114 --> 00:39:14,651
Everything we know is stardust.

515
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,651
So don't forget, you are stardust.

516
00:39:23,875 --> 00:39:25,666
That's very nice and all.

517
00:39:25,752 --> 00:39:30,045
I mean, that we're all stardust,
and you're becoming this great woman.

518
00:39:31,007 --> 00:39:33,248
I hope you don't take that
any more seriously...

519
00:39:33,342 --> 00:39:36,378
than some horoscope
in a daily syndicated newspaper.

520
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:38,048
What are you talking about?

521
00:39:38,138 --> 00:39:40,973
She knew I was on vacation
and we didn't know each other...

522
00:39:41,058 --> 00:39:43,264
and that I was going
to become this great woman.

523
00:39:43,393 --> 00:39:46,596
But what was that
"I am learning" bullshit?

524
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:50,733
That's way condescending, you know?
I mean, she wasn't even doing me.

525
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:55,571
I mean, if opportunists
like that ever had to tell the real truth...

526
00:39:55,655 --> 00:39:57,861
it would put their asses out of business.

527
00:39:57,949 --> 00:40:01,199
I mean, just once
I'd love to see some little old lady...

528
00:40:01,285 --> 00:40:04,203
save up all her money
to go to the fortuneteller.

529
00:40:04,288 --> 00:40:08,831
She'd get there all excited about hearing
her future, and the woman would say:

530
00:40:09,585 --> 00:40:14,579
"Tomorrow and all your remaining days
will be exactly like today...

531
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:17,628
"a tedious collection of hours.

532
00:40:17,718 --> 00:40:21,169
"And you will have no new passions
and no new thoughts...

533
00:40:21,263 --> 00:40:23,136
"and no new travels.

534
00:40:23,723 --> 00:40:26,345
"And when you die,
you'll be completely forgotten.

535
00:40:27,811 --> 00:40:30,681
"Fifty schillings, please."
That I'd like to see.

536
00:40:32,065 --> 00:40:33,725
It's so funny how...

537
00:40:33,941 --> 00:40:37,357
she almost didn't notice you.
It's weird. I wonder why.

538
00:40:37,445 --> 00:40:40,730
- She was really wise and intense.
- Yeah.

539
00:40:40,823 --> 00:40:43,112
- I really loved what she said.
- Of course you do.

540
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,869
You pay to hear what makes
you feel good about yourself.

541
00:40:45,953 --> 00:40:49,571
Maybe there's a seedy section of Vienna.
We can buy a hit of crack.

542
00:40:49,665 --> 00:40:53,164
- Would you like that? Yeah?
- You're so...

543
00:40:54,795 --> 00:40:56,704
Stardust.

544
00:41:06,264 --> 00:41:08,055
There's an exhibition.

545
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:12,634
Yeah. I guess we'll miss it.
It doesn't start until next week.

546
00:41:13,437 --> 00:41:15,097
Yeah, I think so.

547
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:20,936
I actually saw this one
a few years ago in a museum.

548
00:41:21,945 --> 00:41:23,737
I stared and stared at it.

549
00:41:24,114 --> 00:41:25,941
Must have been 45 minutes.

550
00:41:27,159 --> 00:41:28,273
I love it.

551
00:41:28,994 --> 00:41:31,152
La voïe ferrée. It's great.

552
00:41:33,164 --> 00:41:37,079
I love the way the people seem
to be dissolving into the background.

553
00:41:38,086 --> 00:41:39,496
Look at this one.

554
00:41:41,005 --> 00:41:44,421
It's like the environments
are stronger than the people.

555
00:41:46,719 --> 00:41:49,755
His human figures
are always so transitory.

556
00:41:50,014 --> 00:41:52,053
It's funny. Transitory?

557
00:41:52,266 --> 00:41:53,677
Transitory.

558
00:42:13,025 --> 00:42:15,979
- You think this is open?
- I don't know. Let's try it.

559
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:44,509
I was in an old church like this...

560
00:42:44,597 --> 00:42:47,882
with my grandmother
a few days ago in Budapest.

561
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:52,728
Even though I reject
most of the religious thing...

562
00:42:52,896 --> 00:42:56,680
I can't help but feeling
for those people that come here...

563
00:42:57,025 --> 00:42:59,812
lost or in pain, guilt...

564
00:43:01,113 --> 00:43:03,604
Looking for some kind of answers.

565
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:08,781
It fascinates me how a single place
can join so much pain and happiness...

566
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:10,862
of so many generations.

567
00:43:11,497 --> 00:43:13,704
You're close with your grandmother?

568
00:43:15,585 --> 00:43:16,699
Yeah.

569
00:43:19,088 --> 00:43:22,504
I think it's because I always have
this strange feeling...

570
00:43:23,008 --> 00:43:26,294
that I'm this very old woman
laying down, about to die.

571
00:43:28,597 --> 00:43:32,345
You know, that my life
is just her memories or something.

572
00:43:36,563 --> 00:43:38,141
That's so wild.

573
00:43:40,191 --> 00:43:42,861
I always think
that I'm still this 13-year-old boy...

574
00:43:42,944 --> 00:43:45,613
who doesn't really know
how to be an adult...

575
00:43:45,697 --> 00:43:48,069
pretending to live my life...

576
00:43:48,157 --> 00:43:51,111
taking notes for when
I'll really have to do it.

577
00:43:52,328 --> 00:43:55,412
Like I'm in a dress rehearsal
for a junior high play.

578
00:43:57,583 --> 00:43:59,042
That's funny.

579
00:43:59,835 --> 00:44:02,408
Then up there in the Ferris wheel,
it was like this...

580
00:44:02,504 --> 00:44:05,838
very old woman
kissing this very young boy. Right?

581
00:44:11,263 --> 00:44:14,797
Do you know anything about the Quakers,
the Quaker religion?

582
00:44:15,725 --> 00:44:16,970
No, not much.

583
00:44:17,644 --> 00:44:21,724
I went to this Quaker wedding once
and it was fantastic.

584
00:44:22,732 --> 00:44:24,107
What they do is...

585
00:44:24,192 --> 00:44:28,319
the couple comes in and they kneel down
in front of the whole congregation...

586
00:44:28,404 --> 00:44:30,562
and they just stare at each other.

587
00:44:31,282 --> 00:44:35,113
Nobody says a word unless they feel
that God moves them to speak...

588
00:44:35,411 --> 00:44:36,953
or say something.

589
00:44:37,996 --> 00:44:40,570
And then, after an hour or so of just...

590
00:44:42,209 --> 00:44:45,126
staring at each other they're married.

591
00:44:47,881 --> 00:44:49,838
That's beautiful. I like that.

592
00:45:06,607 --> 00:45:08,350
This is a horrible story.

593
00:45:09,234 --> 00:45:10,266
What?

594
00:45:10,736 --> 00:45:13,309
- It's not the appropriate place to tell it.
- What?

595
00:45:13,405 --> 00:45:16,240
Well, I was driving around
with this buddy of mine.

596
00:45:16,324 --> 00:45:18,282
He's a big atheist, you know.

597
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:21,495
And he came to a stop
next to this homeless guy.

598
00:45:21,663 --> 00:45:23,786
My buddy takes out a $100 bill...

599
00:45:24,165 --> 00:45:25,707
and leans out the window...

600
00:45:25,792 --> 00:45:28,911
and he says, "Do you believe in God?"

601
00:45:29,879 --> 00:45:33,164
And the guy looks at my friend,
he looks at the money.

602
00:45:33,883 --> 00:45:35,258
He says:

603
00:45:36,093 --> 00:45:37,469
"Yes, I do."

604
00:45:37,970 --> 00:45:41,173
My friend says, "Wrong answer."
We drove away.

605
00:45:42,474 --> 00:45:44,882
- That's mean.
- Yeah.

606
00:45:54,945 --> 00:45:58,989
Would you be in Paris by now
if you hadn't gotten off the train with me?

607
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:00,949
No, not yet.

608
00:46:02,243 --> 00:46:03,654
What would you be doing?

609
00:46:03,745 --> 00:46:06,662
I'd be hanging around the airport,
reading magazines...

610
00:46:06,747 --> 00:46:09,832
crying in my coffee
because you didn't come with me.

611
00:46:14,129 --> 00:46:18,044
I'd probably gotten off the train
in Salzburg with someone else.

612
00:46:18,133 --> 00:46:20,375
Oh, yeah? Oh, I see.

613
00:46:20,469 --> 00:46:25,296
So I'm just a dumb American momentarily
decorating your blank canvas?

614
00:46:26,725 --> 00:46:28,267
I'm having a great time.

615
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:29,549
- Really?
- Yeah.

616
00:46:30,061 --> 00:46:31,306
Me, too.

617
00:46:33,106 --> 00:46:35,312
I'm glad because no one knows I'm here...

618
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:39,729
and I don't know anyone that would
tell me all those bad things you've done.

619
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:42,062
- I'll tell you some.
- Yeah, I'm sure.

620
00:46:43,032 --> 00:46:45,783
You know, you hear
so much shit about people.

621
00:46:46,118 --> 00:46:49,867
I always feel like the general of an army
when I start dating a guy.

622
00:46:49,955 --> 00:46:52,113
Plotting my strategy and maneuverings...

623
00:46:52,207 --> 00:46:55,956
knowing his weak points,
what would hurt him, seduce him.

624
00:46:56,086 --> 00:46:57,628
It's horrible.

625
00:47:01,716 --> 00:47:03,792
If we were with each other always...

626
00:47:03,885 --> 00:47:07,218
what would be the first thing
about me that would drive you mad?

627
00:47:07,931 --> 00:47:10,552
No. I'm not going to answer this question.

628
00:47:10,641 --> 00:47:14,769
I dated this girl once
who used to always ask me that.

629
00:47:14,854 --> 00:47:16,431
"What about me bugs you?"

630
00:47:16,522 --> 00:47:20,306
Finally, I said, "I don't think
you handle criticism too well."

631
00:47:20,484 --> 00:47:23,770
She flew into a rage
and broke up with me. That's a true story.

632
00:47:23,862 --> 00:47:25,191
All she ever wanted to do...

633
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:28,566
was to have an excuse to tell me
what she thought was wrong with me.

634
00:47:29,076 --> 00:47:30,404
- Is that what you want?
- What?

635
00:47:30,494 --> 00:47:32,486
- Something about me bugs you?
- No.

636
00:47:32,579 --> 00:47:35,782
- What is it about me bugs you?
- Nothing at all.

637
00:47:35,874 --> 00:47:38,543
If it had to be something,
what would it be?

638
00:47:38,626 --> 00:47:42,291
If it had to be something,
if I had to think about it...

639
00:47:42,505 --> 00:47:46,170
I kind of didn't really like this reaction
at the palm reader.

640
00:47:46,259 --> 00:47:48,335
You were like this rooster prick.

641
00:47:48,678 --> 00:47:50,754
What the hell is a rooster prick?

642
00:47:50,846 --> 00:47:54,796
You were like a boy whining because
all the attention wasn't focused on him.

643
00:47:54,892 --> 00:47:58,058
All right, listen.
This woman robs you blind, okay?

644
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:01,225
You were like a boy
walking by an ice-cream store...

645
00:48:01,315 --> 00:48:04,019
crying because his mother
won't buy him a milkshake.

646
00:48:04,109 --> 00:48:06,647
I don't care what this charlatan
has to say about...

647
00:48:06,736 --> 00:48:07,768
Hello?

648
00:48:09,447 --> 00:48:10,610
What?

649
00:48:13,493 --> 00:48:16,944
I understand a little bit,
but he doesn't at all. I'm sorry.

650
00:48:17,330 --> 00:48:18,444
Okay.

651
00:48:19,916 --> 00:48:22,869
- May I ask you a question?
- Yeah.

652
00:48:24,378 --> 00:48:27,083
I would like to make a deal with you.

653
00:48:28,674 --> 00:48:32,802
I mean, instead of just asking you
for money, I will ask you for a word.

654
00:48:33,303 --> 00:48:35,711
You give me a word, I take the word...

655
00:48:35,806 --> 00:48:39,009
and then I will write a poem
with the word inside.

656
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:43,229
And if you like it, if you like my poem...

657
00:48:43,438 --> 00:48:46,107
if you feel it adds something to your life
in any way...

658
00:48:46,191 --> 00:48:48,860
then you can pay me
whatever you feel like.

659
00:48:49,402 --> 00:48:51,560
I'll write in English, of course.

660
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:54,654
- Okay. Great.
- All right. Great.

661
00:48:57,034 --> 00:48:58,113
So?

662
00:49:00,204 --> 00:49:01,402
Pick a word.

663
00:49:03,332 --> 00:49:04,530
A word.

664
00:49:06,001 --> 00:49:08,492
- Milkshake.
- Milkshake? Good.

665
00:49:08,587 --> 00:49:11,504
I was gonna say "rooster prick."
But great. Milkshake.

666
00:49:11,590 --> 00:49:12,788
Milkshake?

667
00:49:13,717 --> 00:49:15,425
Okay, milkshake.

668
00:49:16,052 --> 00:49:17,712
- All right, so...
- Good.

669
00:49:29,106 --> 00:49:33,234
I gotta say,
I like this Viennese variation of bum.

670
00:49:33,319 --> 00:49:36,522
I like what he said
about adding something to your life.

671
00:49:36,864 --> 00:49:40,197
So, were we having our first fight
back there?

672
00:49:40,784 --> 00:49:43,820
- No.
- I think so. I think we were.

673
00:49:44,162 --> 00:49:48,160
Even if we were, why does everyone think
conflict is so bad?

674
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:51,120
There's a lot of good things
coming out of conflict.

675
00:49:51,211 --> 00:49:52,788
Yeah, I guess so.

676
00:49:54,255 --> 00:49:56,746
I always think
if I could just accept the fact...

677
00:49:56,841 --> 00:50:00,673
that my life was supposed to be difficult,
that's what's to be expected...

678
00:50:00,762 --> 00:50:02,884
then I might not get so pissed off about it.

679
00:50:02,972 --> 00:50:05,677
And I'd just be glad
when something nice happens.

680
00:50:05,850 --> 00:50:07,723
Maybe that's why I'm still in school.

681
00:50:07,810 --> 00:50:10,301
It's easier to have something
to fight against.

682
00:50:11,188 --> 00:50:14,272
We've all had such competitiveness
ingrained in us.

683
00:50:14,441 --> 00:50:16,564
I can be doing the most nothing thing.

684
00:50:16,652 --> 00:50:20,151
I can be throwing some darts
or shooting some pool.

685
00:50:20,363 --> 00:50:23,033
Then all of a sudden,
I feel it come over me.

686
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:24,943
I have got to win.

687
00:50:25,827 --> 00:50:29,410
Is that why you tried to get me
off the train? Competitiveness?

688
00:50:29,539 --> 00:50:31,247
- What do you mean?
- Okay.

689
00:50:32,792 --> 00:50:35,283
- I got you a poem.
- All right.

690
00:50:37,588 --> 00:50:39,296
Will you read it to us?

691
00:50:42,843 --> 00:50:44,088
Sure. Okay.

692
00:50:48,432 --> 00:50:50,175
"Daydream delusion

693
00:50:50,809 --> 00:50:52,517

00:50:59,192 --> 00:51:00,900

00:51:01,569 --> 00:51:03,609

00:51:03,988 --> 00:51:06,313

00:51:07,033 --> 00:51:08,942

00:51:09,952 --> 00:51:11,826

00:51:38,104 --> 00:51:39,931
"Don't you know me by now?"

710
00:51:41,023 --> 00:51:42,221
Great.

711
00:51:43,109 --> 00:51:44,982
- Thanks.
- Thanks, man.

712
00:51:48,739 --> 00:51:50,233
Here you go.

713
00:51:51,992 --> 00:51:53,652
- Thanks.
- All right.

714
00:51:53,744 --> 00:51:55,736
- Here. Thank you.
- Thank you.

715
00:51:56,246 --> 00:51:57,444
Good luck.

716
00:51:57,539 --> 00:51:58,950
- Bye.
- Bye.

717
00:52:13,429 --> 00:52:15,588
- It was wonderful, no?
- Yeah.

718
00:52:19,769 --> 00:52:22,438
- What?
- He probably didn't just write that.

719
00:52:22,521 --> 00:52:25,475
He wrote it,
but he probably plugs that word in.

720
00:52:25,566 --> 00:52:27,724
You know, whatever, "milkshake."

721
00:52:27,985 --> 00:52:31,567
- What do you mean?
- Nothing. I loved it. It was great.

722
00:52:39,537 --> 00:52:41,329
- You know what drives me crazy?
- What?

723
00:52:41,414 --> 00:52:45,364
People always talk about how great
technology is, how it saves all this time.

724
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:48,544
But what good is saved time
if nobody uses it?

725
00:52:48,629 --> 00:52:51,085
- It just turns into more busy work.
- Yeah.

726
00:52:51,173 --> 00:52:55,800
You never hear anyone say, "With the time
I've saved by using my word processor...

727
00:52:55,886 --> 00:52:58,721
"I'm gonna go to a Zen monastery
and hang out."

728
00:52:59,056 --> 00:53:01,973
- You don't hear that.
- Time is abstract anyway.

729
00:53:02,267 --> 00:53:04,593
- Were you looking at this girl?
- What?

730
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:06,306
Nothing.

731
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:08,640
- You wanna go in here?
- What?

732
00:53:08,732 --> 00:53:11,898
- You wanna go in here?
- Yeah. It's a club, no?

733
00:53:14,070 --> 00:53:16,110
Wanna go? Hello.

734
00:53:18,491 --> 00:53:19,866
Fifty schillings.

735
00:53:20,493 --> 00:53:23,198
- Each.
- I got a 100. Here, I got it.

736
00:53:24,247 --> 00:53:26,286
I'll buy you a beer. Thank you.

737
00:54:14,127 --> 00:54:16,001
- You gonna buy me a beer?
- Yeah.

738
00:54:20,508 --> 00:54:23,046
You think Old Milwaukee
is expensive here?

739
00:54:50,996 --> 00:54:55,040
We haven't talked about this yet,
but are you dating anyone?

740
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:59,621
You got a boyfriend waiting on you
back in Paris or anything like that?

741
00:54:59,712 --> 00:55:02,168
- No, not right now.
- But you did.

742
00:55:03,883 --> 00:55:06,338
- We broke up six months ago.
- Six months ago?

743
00:55:06,427 --> 00:55:07,969
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry.

744
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:11,341
I mean, I'm not that sorry.
But tell me about it.

745
00:55:11,432 --> 00:55:15,299
No, no way. I can't. It's really boring.

746
00:55:15,394 --> 00:55:17,470
Come on. Tell me about it.

747
00:55:18,272 --> 00:55:21,107
Okay. I was really disappointed.

748
00:55:21,316 --> 00:55:23,060
I thought this one would last a while.

749
00:55:23,193 --> 00:55:28,400
I mean, he was very stupid,
ugly, bad in bed, alcoholic...

750
00:55:29,741 --> 00:55:31,484
- You know.
- A real prize winner.

751
00:55:33,328 --> 00:55:35,450
I was kind of giving him a favor.

752
00:55:35,621 --> 00:55:38,575
But he left me,
saying I loved him too much.

753
00:55:38,666 --> 00:55:42,711
I was blocking his artistic expression
or some shit like that.

754
00:55:43,921 --> 00:55:46,293
But anyway, I was traumatized...

755
00:55:47,258 --> 00:55:49,333
and became totally obsessed with him.

756
00:55:50,052 --> 00:55:51,332
So I went to a shrink...

757
00:55:51,428 --> 00:55:54,678
and it came up that I had written
this little stupid story...

758
00:55:54,765 --> 00:55:57,600
about this woman
trying to kill her boyfriend...

759
00:55:58,768 --> 00:56:01,888
and how she was gonna do it
with all the intricate details...

760
00:56:02,105 --> 00:56:05,723
- of how to do it and not get caught...
- She was gonna kill her boyfriend?

761
00:56:07,485 --> 00:56:09,110
Yeah, she was.

762
00:56:09,946 --> 00:56:12,650
It's nothing I would do,
but it was just some writing.

763
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:13,771
No, I understand.

764
00:56:13,866 --> 00:56:16,820
But anyway this stupid shrink believed
everything I told her.

765
00:56:16,911 --> 00:56:20,659
It was my first time seeing her.
She said she had to call the police.

766
00:56:20,748 --> 00:56:22,408
- She had to call the police?
- Yes.

767
00:56:22,499 --> 00:56:23,994
She was... Merde!

768
00:56:24,168 --> 00:56:26,789
She was totally convinced
I was really gonna do it.

769
00:56:27,379 --> 00:56:30,296
Even though I had explained
it was just some writing.

770
00:56:30,382 --> 00:56:32,421
She said, looking deep into my eyes:

771
00:56:32,509 --> 00:56:35,130
"The way you said it
I know you are going to do it.

772
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:38,386
"The way you said it."
She was totally out of her mind.

773
00:56:39,098 --> 00:56:42,882
- It was my first and last session.
- So what happened then?

774
00:56:45,521 --> 00:56:47,430
I totally got over him.

775
00:56:47,690 --> 00:56:49,398
But now I'm obsessed...

776
00:56:49,567 --> 00:56:53,611
that he's gonna die from an accident
or 1000 kilometers away.

777
00:56:53,863 --> 00:56:56,069
And I'm gonna be the one accused.

778
00:56:59,034 --> 00:57:03,032
Why is it you become obsessed
with people you don't like that much?

779
00:57:03,121 --> 00:57:05,577
- You know what I mean?
- I don't know.

780
00:57:07,667 --> 00:57:09,078
So how about you?

781
00:57:10,628 --> 00:57:12,751
- What?
- Are you with anyone?

782
00:57:14,841 --> 00:57:18,423
It's funny how we managed to avoid
this subject for so long, isn't it?

783
00:57:18,803 --> 00:57:20,594
But now you have to tell me.

784
00:57:20,805 --> 00:57:23,047
Well, I kind of see love...

785
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:26,805
as this escape for two people
who don't know how to be alone.

786
00:57:28,562 --> 00:57:31,848
I mean, it's funny.
People always talk about how...

787
00:57:31,940 --> 00:57:34,894
Love is this totally unselfish, giving thing.

788
00:57:34,985 --> 00:57:38,188
But if you think about it,
there's nothing more selfish.

789
00:57:38,989 --> 00:57:40,234
I know.

790
00:57:40,949 --> 00:57:43,107
So, who just broke up with you?

791
00:57:44,911 --> 00:57:46,074
What?

792
00:57:48,414 --> 00:57:50,573
You sound like you've just been hurt.

793
00:57:50,958 --> 00:57:52,453
- Do I?
- Yeah.

794
00:57:52,543 --> 00:57:53,788
All right.

795
00:57:54,962 --> 00:57:56,540
Big confession.

796
00:57:56,631 --> 00:57:59,382
I should've told you this earlier
or something.

797
00:58:00,718 --> 00:58:03,921
I didn't come to Europe just to hang out...

798
00:58:04,013 --> 00:58:07,049
and read Hemingway in Paris
and shit like that.

799
00:58:07,307 --> 00:58:10,676
I saved up my money all spring
to fly to Madrid...

800
00:58:10,769 --> 00:58:13,604
and spend the summer with my girlfriend
who's been on...

801
00:58:13,688 --> 00:58:15,515
- Your girlfriend?
- My ex-girlfriend...

802
00:58:15,607 --> 00:58:19,023
who has been on this asinine
art history program for the last year.

803
00:58:19,110 --> 00:58:22,693
Anyway, I got here.
We were reunited at long last...

804
00:58:22,780 --> 00:58:26,481
and we went out to dinner, our first night,
with six of her friends.

805
00:58:27,076 --> 00:58:31,904
Pedro, Antonio, Gonzalo,
Maria, Suzy from home.

806
00:58:32,164 --> 00:58:36,078
She avoided being alone with me for
the first couple of days we were there...

807
00:58:36,168 --> 00:58:40,711
and I stuck around for a while just to let it
sink in that she wished I hadn't come.

808
00:58:42,174 --> 00:58:46,171
So I bought the cheapest flight out,
this one leaving out of Vienna tomorrow...

809
00:58:46,261 --> 00:58:50,175
but it didn't leave for a couple weeks,
so I bought this Eurail pass.

810
00:58:51,182 --> 00:58:55,346
You know what's the worst thing
about somebody breaking up with you?

811
00:58:56,312 --> 00:58:58,981
It's when you remember
how little you thought...

812
00:58:59,065 --> 00:59:00,974
about the people you broke up with...

813
00:59:01,067 --> 00:59:05,360
and you realize that that is how little
they're thinking about you.

814
00:59:06,072 --> 00:59:08,609
You'd like to think
you're both in all this pain...

815
00:59:08,699 --> 00:59:11,819
but really, they're just,
"Hey, I'm glad you're gone."

816
00:59:11,910 --> 00:59:13,654
Believe me, I know.

817
00:59:14,496 --> 00:59:17,367
- You should look at bright colors.
- What?

818
00:59:18,208 --> 00:59:20,201
That's what the shrink told me.

819
00:59:20,293 --> 00:59:25,251
I was paying her 900 francs an hour
to hear that I was a homicidal maniac...

820
00:59:25,465 --> 00:59:29,509
but I could shift my obsession
if I would concentrate on bright colors.

821
00:59:29,594 --> 00:59:30,792
Did it work?

822
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:36,882
- Didn't help your pinball.
- Well, no.

823
00:59:37,351 --> 00:59:41,135
Yeah, well, you know,
I haven't killed anyone lately.

824
00:59:41,313 --> 00:59:44,563
Not lately? That's good. You're cured then.

825
00:59:51,323 --> 00:59:54,774
There's these breeds of monkeys,
and all they do is have sex...

826
00:59:54,868 --> 00:59:56,492
all the time, you know?

827
00:59:56,578 --> 01:00:01,240
They turn out to be the least violent,
the most peaceful, the most happy.

828
01:00:01,332 --> 01:00:04,499
So maybe fooling around is not so bad.

829
01:00:04,836 --> 01:00:07,955
- Are you talking about monkeys?
- Yes, I'm talking about monkeys.

830
01:00:08,464 --> 01:00:09,709
- I thought so.
- Why?

831
01:00:09,799 --> 01:00:11,341
I never heard this one.

832
01:00:11,425 --> 01:00:14,426
But it reminds me
of this perfect male argument...

833
01:00:14,512 --> 01:00:16,219
to justify them fooling around.

834
01:00:16,305 --> 01:00:19,970
Women monkeys are fooling around, too.
Everybody's fooling around.

835
01:00:20,559 --> 01:00:24,603
Yeah, that's cute.
I have this awful, paranoid thought...

836
01:00:24,688 --> 01:00:27,891
that feminism
was mostly invented by men...

837
01:00:27,983 --> 01:00:30,141
so they could fool around a little more.

838
01:00:30,235 --> 01:00:33,438
"Woman, free your mind,
free your body. Sleep with me.

839
01:00:33,530 --> 01:00:37,313
"We're all happy and free,
as long as I can fuck as much as I can."

840
01:00:38,951 --> 01:00:42,819
All right. But maybe there's
some biological things at work here.

841
01:00:43,623 --> 01:00:45,283
If you had an island...

842
01:00:45,374 --> 01:00:49,917
and there were 99 women on the island
and only one man...

843
01:00:50,170 --> 01:00:52,875
in a year,
you'd have the possibility of 99 babies.

844
01:00:52,965 --> 01:00:56,630
But if you have an island
with 99 men and only one woman...

845
01:00:56,718 --> 01:00:59,589
in a year,
you have the possibility of only one baby.

846
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:01,174
So...

847
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:02,719
You know what?

848
01:01:02,808 --> 01:01:06,722
On this island, I think there will be
only maybe 43 men left.

849
01:01:07,062 --> 01:01:10,644
They would've killed each other
trying to fuck this poor woman.

850
01:01:11,024 --> 01:01:12,304
On the other island...

851
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:16,611
there would be 99 women, 99 babies,
and no more man.

852
01:01:17,488 --> 01:01:20,275
Because they would've gotten together
and eaten him alive.

853
01:01:20,366 --> 01:01:21,908
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

854
01:01:22,076 --> 01:01:23,867
There's something to that.

855
01:01:23,953 --> 01:01:27,902
On some level, women don't mind the idea
of destroying a man.

856
01:01:29,082 --> 01:01:32,036
I was once walking down the street
with my ex-girlfriend...

857
01:01:32,127 --> 01:01:36,374
and we'd just walked by these four
thuggy-looking guys next to a Camaro.

858
01:01:37,132 --> 01:01:40,298
And one of them says,
"Hey, baby, nice ass!"

859
01:01:40,385 --> 01:01:43,884
So I'm like, "No big deal.
I won't get uptight about this."

860
01:01:44,264 --> 01:01:47,181
- Plus, there were four of them.
- Exactly.

861
01:01:47,266 --> 01:01:49,223
She turns and says,
"Fuck you, dickheads!"

862
01:01:49,310 --> 01:01:52,560
And I'm like, "Okay. Wait a minute here."

863
01:01:52,647 --> 01:01:55,351
They're not gonna come over
and kick her ass.

864
01:01:55,441 --> 01:01:58,358
So who just got pushed to the frontline
on that one?

865
01:01:58,444 --> 01:02:01,647
Women say they hate it
if you're all territorial and protective...

866
01:02:01,739 --> 01:02:06,199
but if it suits them, then they'll tell you
you're being all unmanly, or wimpy, or...

867
01:02:06,285 --> 01:02:09,903
You know what? I don't think
women really want to destroy men.

868
01:02:11,289 --> 01:02:13,780
Even if they want to, they don't succeed.

869
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,123
I'm sure even men
are destroying women...

870
01:02:16,211 --> 01:02:19,414
or are able or capable of destroying
women, much more than women.

871
01:02:19,505 --> 01:02:21,996
Anyway, it's depressing.
I mean, you know what?

872
01:02:22,091 --> 01:02:24,547
- You wanna stop talking about this?
- I hate it.

873
01:02:24,635 --> 01:02:27,636
Men, women, it's... There's no end to this.

874
01:02:29,598 --> 01:02:31,390
- It's like a skipping record.
- Yeah.

875
01:02:31,475 --> 01:02:34,511
Every couple's been
having this conversation forever.

876
01:02:34,770 --> 01:02:36,976
And nobody came up with anything.

877
01:02:53,538 --> 01:02:56,111
I saw a documentary on that.
It's a birth dance.

878
01:02:56,207 --> 01:02:57,950
- A birth dance?
- Yeah.

879
01:03:26,069 --> 01:03:27,942
Should I give her some money?

880
01:03:28,029 --> 01:03:30,899
Everything that's interesting
costs a little bit of money.

881
01:03:33,159 --> 01:03:34,819
So, a birth dance?

882
01:03:34,994 --> 01:03:37,698
Looked a little bit
like a mating dance to me.

883
01:03:37,872 --> 01:03:40,742
No, but really.
Women used it when giving birth.

884
01:03:40,958 --> 01:03:43,330
In some part of the world, they still do it.

885
01:03:44,628 --> 01:03:47,201
The woman in labor enters a tent...

886
01:03:47,297 --> 01:03:49,870
and the women of her tribe
surround her and dance.

887
01:03:49,966 --> 01:03:52,636
They encourage the birthing woman
to dance with them...

888
01:03:52,719 --> 01:03:54,877
so as to make the birth less painful.

889
01:03:55,013 --> 01:03:58,132
And when the baby is born,
they all dance in celebration.

890
01:03:59,601 --> 01:04:02,270
I don't think my mom
would've gone for that.

891
01:04:02,395 --> 01:04:04,850
I like the idea of dancing
as a common function.

892
01:04:04,939 --> 01:04:07,608
- Something everybody participates in.
- I know.

893
01:04:07,775 --> 01:04:12,104
I heard about this old guy who was
watching some young people dance.

894
01:04:12,530 --> 01:04:13,940
He said, "How beautiful.

895
01:04:14,031 --> 01:04:17,151
"They're trying to shake off their genitals,
and become angels."

896
01:04:17,242 --> 01:04:19,698
- I like that.
- One question, though, back there.

897
01:04:19,786 --> 01:04:23,286
When the women are dancing
and being all spiritual and stuff...

898
01:04:23,373 --> 01:04:24,832
where are the men?

899
01:04:24,916 --> 01:04:28,830
Are we out food gathering?
Are we not invited? You all don't need us?

900
01:04:29,087 --> 01:04:31,874
Men are lucky
we don't bite off their heads after mating.

901
01:04:31,965 --> 01:04:34,800
Certain insects do that,
like spiders and stuff?

902
01:04:35,093 --> 01:04:37,714
We let you live.
What are you complaining about?

903
01:04:37,804 --> 01:04:41,338
See, you're officially kidding.
But there's something to that.

904
01:04:41,557 --> 01:04:43,680
- You keep bringing stuff like that up.
- What?

905
01:04:43,768 --> 01:04:45,974
- Yeah.
- No, wait a minute.

906
01:04:46,312 --> 01:04:47,854
Talking seriously here...

907
01:04:48,981 --> 01:04:53,726
I feel this pressure of being a strong
and independent icon of womanhood...

908
01:04:53,860 --> 01:04:58,606
and not making it look like my whole life
is revolving around some guy.

909
01:04:59,199 --> 01:05:01,772
But loving someone...

910
01:05:02,327 --> 01:05:04,996
and being loved means so much to me.

911
01:05:06,331 --> 01:05:08,952
I always make fun of it and stuff...

912
01:05:09,667 --> 01:05:14,163
but isn't everything we do in life
a way to be loved a little more?

913
01:05:18,968 --> 01:05:20,378
I don't know.

914
01:05:20,761 --> 01:05:23,003
Sometimes I dream...

915
01:05:23,097 --> 01:05:25,967
about being a good father
and a good husband.

916
01:05:26,058 --> 01:05:28,181
And sometimes it feels really close.

917
01:05:29,394 --> 01:05:31,351
But then other times...

918
01:05:32,355 --> 01:05:34,265
it seems silly...

919
01:05:34,608 --> 01:05:38,190
like it would ruin my whole life.

920
01:05:38,987 --> 01:05:41,691
And it's not just a fear of commitment...

921
01:05:41,781 --> 01:05:46,277
or that I'm incapable of caring or loving
because I can.

922
01:05:47,828 --> 01:05:51,280
It's just that,
if I'm totally honest with myself...

923
01:05:52,208 --> 01:05:56,501
I think I'd rather die knowing
that I was really good at something.

924
01:05:56,754 --> 01:05:59,244
That I had excelled in some way...

925
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:04,418
than that I had just been
in a nice, caring relationship.

926
01:06:11,476 --> 01:06:14,642
I had worked for this older man,
and once he told me...

927
01:06:15,063 --> 01:06:18,894
that he had spent all of his life
thinking about his career and his work.

928
01:06:18,983 --> 01:06:21,391
He was 52, and it suddenly struck him...

929
01:06:21,902 --> 01:06:24,903
that he had never really
given anything of himself.

930
01:06:25,448 --> 01:06:28,069
His life was for no one and nothing.

931
01:06:29,201 --> 01:06:31,692
He was almost crying saying that.

932
01:06:34,540 --> 01:06:37,209
You know, I believe
if there's any kind of God...

933
01:06:37,292 --> 01:06:40,791
it wouldn't be in any of us,
not you or me...

934
01:06:42,130 --> 01:06:44,455
but just this little space in between.

935
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:50,430
If there's any kind of magic in this world...

936
01:06:50,555 --> 01:06:55,015
it must be in the attempt of understanding
someone, sharing something.

937
01:06:57,186 --> 01:07:00,187
I know it's almost impossible to succeed...

938
01:07:01,398 --> 01:07:03,307
but who cares, really?

939
01:07:04,193 --> 01:07:06,518
The answer must be in the attempt.

940
01:08:15,052 --> 01:08:18,883
I really think this is a civilization
in decline. Look at the service.

941
01:08:18,972 --> 01:08:20,680
- The service?
- Where is the waitress?

942
01:08:20,765 --> 01:08:22,639
In New York, she'd be out of a job.

943
01:08:31,442 --> 01:08:33,316
I'm gonna call my best friend in Paris...

944
01:08:33,402 --> 01:08:36,688
who I'm supposed to have lunch with
in eight hours, okay?

945
01:08:45,247 --> 01:08:46,706
- Pick up.
- What?

946
01:08:46,790 --> 01:08:48,866
- Pick up the phone.
- Hello?

947
01:09:01,513 --> 01:09:05,925
I've been working on my English recently.
You wanna talk in English, for laughs?

948
01:09:06,017 --> 01:09:07,890
Yeah, okay. That's a good idea.

949
01:09:10,187 --> 01:09:13,639
I don't think I'll be able to make it
for lunch today. I'm sorry.

950
01:09:15,317 --> 01:09:19,231
I met a guy on the train, and I got off
with him in Vienna. We're still there.

951
01:09:19,321 --> 01:09:21,230
Are you crazy?

952
01:09:22,282 --> 01:09:23,611
Probably.

953
01:09:24,534 --> 01:09:27,156
- He's Austrian? He's from there?
- No.

954
01:09:27,329 --> 01:09:31,196
He's passing through. He's American.
He's going back home tomorrow morning.

955
01:09:31,291 --> 01:09:33,616
Why did you get off the train with him?

956
01:09:33,877 --> 01:09:35,786
Well, he convinced me.

957
01:09:37,297 --> 01:09:41,164
I mean, actually, I was ready
to get off the train with him...

958
01:09:41,342 --> 01:09:45,256
after talking to him a short while.
He was so sweet, I couldn't help it.

959
01:09:46,847 --> 01:09:49,848
We were in the lounge car
and he began to talk about him...

960
01:09:49,934 --> 01:09:53,018
as a little boy
seeing his great-grandmother's ghost.

961
01:09:53,937 --> 01:09:56,309
I think that's when I fell for him.

962
01:09:57,316 --> 01:10:01,265
Just the idea of this little boy
with all those beautiful dreams.

963
01:10:02,571 --> 01:10:03,816
He trapped me.

964
01:10:07,492 --> 01:10:10,943
And he's so cute.
He has beautiful blue eyes...

965
01:10:11,704 --> 01:10:13,282
nice pink lips...

966
01:10:14,457 --> 01:10:16,034
greasy hair.

967
01:10:16,584 --> 01:10:17,959
I love it.

968
01:10:18,794 --> 01:10:21,629
He's kind of tall, and he's a little clumsy.

969
01:10:23,340 --> 01:10:26,092
I like to feel his eyes on me
when I look away.

970
01:10:30,472 --> 01:10:33,675
He kind of kisses like an adolescent.
It's so cute.

971
01:10:33,767 --> 01:10:35,759
- What?
- Yeah, we kissed.

972
01:10:36,102 --> 01:10:37,513
It was so adorable.

973
01:10:38,229 --> 01:10:41,894
As the night went on,
I began to like him more and more.

974
01:10:43,109 --> 01:10:44,817
But I'm afraid he's scared of me.

975
01:10:44,902 --> 01:10:49,114
I told him the story about the woman
that kills her ex-boyfriend and stuff.

976
01:10:49,574 --> 01:10:51,116
He must be scared to death.

977
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:54,403
He must be thinking
I'm this manipulative, mean woman.

978
01:10:56,705 --> 01:10:59,375
I just hope
he doesn't feel that way about me.

979
01:10:59,458 --> 01:11:02,542
Because, you know me,
I'm the most harmless person.

980
01:11:03,921 --> 01:11:06,625
The only person
I could really hurt is myself.

981
01:11:07,716 --> 01:11:11,381
I don't think he's scared of you.
I think he's crazy about you.

982
01:11:12,304 --> 01:11:14,510
- Really?
- I've known you a long time.

983
01:11:14,597 --> 01:11:17,302
I got a good feeling.
You gonna see him again?

984
01:11:19,811 --> 01:11:21,969
We haven't talked about that yet.

985
01:11:26,859 --> 01:11:29,017
Okay, it's your turn. You call your friend.

986
01:11:29,111 --> 01:11:30,902
- Okay?
- All right.

987
01:11:35,117 --> 01:11:37,442
I usually get
this guy's answering machine.

988
01:11:40,414 --> 01:11:42,038
Hi, dude. What's up?

989
01:11:44,042 --> 01:11:46,794
Hey, Frank. How you been?
I'm glad you're home.

990
01:11:46,878 --> 01:11:49,914
Cool. Yeah. So, how was Madrid?

991
01:11:50,882 --> 01:11:52,459
Madrid sucked.

992
01:11:53,634 --> 01:11:56,422
Lisa and I had our long overdue meltdown.

993
01:11:56,762 --> 01:11:58,921
Too bad. I told you, no?

994
01:11:59,015 --> 01:12:02,015
Yeah. The long-distance thing
just never works.

995
01:12:02,309 --> 01:12:06,770
I was only in Madrid for a couple days.
I got a cheaper flight out of Vienna.

996
01:12:09,149 --> 01:12:12,399
You know,
it really wasn't that much cheaper. I just...

997
01:12:12,653 --> 01:12:16,650
I couldn't go home right away.
I didn't want to see anybody I knew.

998
01:12:16,740 --> 01:12:19,943
I just wanted to be a ghost,
completely anonymous.

999
01:12:21,536 --> 01:12:23,030
- So are you okay now?
- Yeah.

1000
01:12:23,121 --> 01:12:25,528
I'm great. That's the thing.

1001
01:12:26,666 --> 01:12:29,371
I'm rapturous. And I'll tell you why.

1002
01:12:30,002 --> 01:12:33,087
I met somebody on my last night
in Europe. Can you believe it?

1003
01:12:33,172 --> 01:12:35,793
- That's incredible.
- I know.

1004
01:12:35,883 --> 01:12:39,466
You know how they say
we're all each other's demons and angels?

1005
01:12:40,429 --> 01:12:43,299
Well, she was literally a Botticelli angel...

1006
01:12:43,432 --> 01:12:46,765
just telling me
that everything was gonna be okay.

1007
01:12:49,729 --> 01:12:51,140
How did you meet?

1008
01:12:52,399 --> 01:12:53,644
On the train.

1009
01:12:54,359 --> 01:12:58,855
She was sitting next to this weird couple
that started fighting, so she had to move.

1010
01:12:58,947 --> 01:13:02,730
She sat right across the aisle from me.
So we started to talk.

1011
01:13:03,993 --> 01:13:07,409
She didn't like me much at first.
She's super smart...

1012
01:13:07,496 --> 01:13:09,405
very passionate...

1013
01:13:10,291 --> 01:13:11,489
and beautiful.

1014
01:13:13,002 --> 01:13:15,327
And I was so unsure of myself.

1015
01:13:15,838 --> 01:13:18,957
I thought everything I said
sounded so stupid.

1016
01:13:20,175 --> 01:13:24,042
- Man, I wouldn't worry about that.
- No.

1017
01:13:24,137 --> 01:13:26,462
No, I'm sure she was not judging you.

1018
01:13:26,848 --> 01:13:30,928
No, and by the way, she sat next to you.
I'm sure she did it on purpose.

1019
01:13:31,311 --> 01:13:32,686
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1020
01:13:36,357 --> 01:13:40,437
Us men are so stupid. We don't
understand anything about women.

1021
01:13:41,487 --> 01:13:44,156
They act strange, the little I know of them.

1022
01:13:44,573 --> 01:13:45,771
Don't they?

1023
01:13:47,493 --> 01:13:48,655
Yeah.

1024
01:13:52,915 --> 01:13:56,663
I feel like
this is some dream world we're in.

1025
01:13:56,960 --> 01:13:58,751
Yeah, it's so weird.

1026
01:13:59,045 --> 01:14:02,829
It's like our time together is just ours.
It's our own creation.

1027
01:14:03,925 --> 01:14:07,294
It must be like I'm in your dream
and you're in mine or something.

1028
01:14:08,930 --> 01:14:12,595
What's so cool is that this whole evening,
all our time together...

1029
01:14:12,683 --> 01:14:15,055
shouldn't officially be happening.

1030
01:14:15,144 --> 01:14:18,844
Yeah, I know. Maybe that's why
this feels so otherworldly.

1031
01:14:20,691 --> 01:14:24,142
But then the morning comes
and we turn into pumpkins, right?

1032
01:14:24,987 --> 01:14:26,185
I know.

1033
01:14:27,322 --> 01:14:30,442
But now, you're supposed
to produce the glass slipper...

1034
01:14:30,534 --> 01:14:32,111
and see if it fits.

1035
01:14:35,372 --> 01:14:36,652
It'll fit.

1036
01:14:55,099 --> 01:14:56,972
This friend of mine had a kid...

1037
01:14:57,059 --> 01:15:00,225
and it was a home birth,
so he was there helping out.

1038
01:15:00,395 --> 01:15:03,266
But he said
at that profound moment of birth...

1039
01:15:04,816 --> 01:15:08,150
he was watching his child experiencing life
for the first time...

1040
01:15:08,778 --> 01:15:10,818
trying to take its first breath.

1041
01:15:10,905 --> 01:15:14,570
All he could think about was
that he was looking at something...

1042
01:15:14,659 --> 01:15:16,698
that was gonna die someday.

1043
01:15:17,036 --> 01:15:19,609
He just couldn't get it out of his head.

1044
01:15:19,831 --> 01:15:23,745
And I think that's so true.
Everything is so finite.

1045
01:15:23,834 --> 01:15:27,452
But don't you think that's
what makes our time...

1046
01:15:27,546 --> 01:15:29,871
and specific moments so important?

1047
01:15:30,340 --> 01:15:33,590
Yeah, I know.
It's the same for us tonight, though.

1048
01:15:36,596 --> 01:15:40,594
After tomorrow, we're probably
never gonna see each other again, right?

1049
01:15:42,227 --> 01:15:44,800
You don't think
we'll ever see each other again?

1050
01:15:47,023 --> 01:15:48,482
What do you think?

1051
01:15:54,739 --> 01:15:56,731
Actually, I don't know.

1052
01:15:57,241 --> 01:15:59,910
- I hadn't planned another trip...
- Me, too.

1053
01:16:00,077 --> 01:16:02,746
I live in Paris, you live in the U.S.
I understand.

1054
01:16:02,830 --> 01:16:05,534
I'd hate to make you fly.
You hate to fly, right?

1055
01:16:05,624 --> 01:16:07,866
I'm not so scared of flying.

1056
01:16:08,585 --> 01:16:09,748
I mean, I could.

1057
01:16:09,836 --> 01:16:12,588
Well, if you were gonna come to the U. S...

1058
01:16:12,672 --> 01:16:14,879
or if, you know, if I...

1059
01:16:15,133 --> 01:16:17,838
Or, you know, I could come back here.

1060
01:16:18,636 --> 01:16:19,668
What?

1061
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:23,432
No, let's just be rational adults about this.

1062
01:16:26,811 --> 01:16:28,684
Maybe we should try something different.

1063
01:16:28,771 --> 01:16:31,807
It's not so bad
if tonight is our only night, right?

1064
01:16:33,275 --> 01:16:35,351
People exchange numbers, addresses.

1065
01:16:35,444 --> 01:16:38,361
They end up writing once,
calling each other once or twice.

1066
01:16:38,447 --> 01:16:40,238
Right. Fizzles out.

1067
01:16:40,407 --> 01:16:42,898
Yeah, I don't want that. I hate that.

1068
01:16:43,994 --> 01:16:45,571
I hate that, too.

1069
01:16:46,079 --> 01:16:49,662
Why does everybody think
relationships should last forever, anyway?

1070
01:16:49,749 --> 01:16:51,742
Yeah, why? It's stupid.

1071
01:16:53,586 --> 01:16:55,745
But you think tonight's it?

1072
01:16:56,506 --> 01:16:59,590
I mean, that tonight's our only night?

1073
01:17:02,011 --> 01:17:03,920
It's the only way, no?

1074
01:17:07,183 --> 01:17:08,641
Well, all right.

1075
01:17:10,060 --> 01:17:11,519
Let's do it.

1076
01:17:11,645 --> 01:17:13,602
No delusions, no projections.

1077
01:17:15,357 --> 01:17:17,433
We'll just make tonight great.

1078
01:17:20,028 --> 01:17:22,234
- Okay, let's do that.
- Okay.

1079
01:17:38,796 --> 01:17:41,038
We should do some kind of handshake.

1080
01:17:41,507 --> 01:17:42,966
Give me your hand.

1081
01:17:46,261 --> 01:17:50,888
To our one and only night together...

1082
01:17:52,142 --> 01:17:54,265
and the hours that remain.

1083
01:18:03,361 --> 01:18:04,524
What?

1084
01:18:07,156 --> 01:18:10,110
It's just... It's depressing, no?

1085
01:18:11,702 --> 01:18:14,489
Now the only thing
we're gonna think of is...

1086
01:18:14,580 --> 01:18:16,987
when we'll have
to say goodbye tomorrow.

1087
01:18:17,416 --> 01:18:20,701
We could say goodbye now.
Then we won't have to worry about it.

1088
01:18:20,794 --> 01:18:21,992
- Now?
- Yeah.

1089
01:18:22,713 --> 01:18:23,993
Say goodbye.

1090
01:18:24,089 --> 01:18:25,500
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

1091
01:18:27,217 --> 01:18:28,296
Au revoïr.

1092
01:18:28,385 --> 01:18:30,424
- Later.
- Later, yeah.

1093
01:19:00,457 --> 01:19:01,737
Here's the plan.

1094
01:19:01,833 --> 01:19:04,787
You're gonna grab the glasses,
and I'm gonna get the wine.

1095
01:19:05,462 --> 01:19:07,288
- Red wine.
- Red wine. Right.

1096
01:19:07,380 --> 01:19:10,297
- You think you can do that?
- No problem.

1097
01:19:15,304 --> 01:19:17,178
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

1098
01:19:19,558 --> 01:19:20,756
Hello.

1099
01:19:25,230 --> 01:19:27,353
- Do you speak English?
- A bit.

1100
01:19:27,441 --> 01:19:29,517
Yeah? A bit? Well, all right.

1101
01:19:29,610 --> 01:19:33,109
I'm having kind of an odd situation
which is that...

1102
01:19:34,656 --> 01:19:36,613
You see that girl over there?

1103
01:19:39,244 --> 01:19:42,079
- Yeah.
- This is our only night together...

1104
01:19:43,456 --> 01:19:44,867
and she...

1105
01:19:46,751 --> 01:19:47,949
Here's the problem.

1106
01:19:48,044 --> 01:19:50,451
The problem is
that she wants a bottle of red wine...

1107
01:19:50,546 --> 01:19:52,254
and I don't have any money.

1108
01:19:55,134 --> 01:19:57,755
But I was thinking
that you might want to...

1109
01:19:58,387 --> 01:20:03,381
give me the address of this bar and
I would promise to send you the money...

1110
01:20:03,475 --> 01:20:05,966
and you'd be making our night complete.

1111
01:20:06,186 --> 01:20:08,724
- You would send me the money?
- Yes.

1112
01:20:14,235 --> 01:20:15,611
Your hand?

1113
01:20:17,488 --> 01:20:18,651
Okay.

1114
01:20:31,710 --> 01:20:35,542
- For the greatest night in your life.
- Thank you very much.

1115
01:20:59,654 --> 01:21:02,987
So often I've been with people
and shared beautiful moments...

1116
01:21:03,073 --> 01:21:07,201
like traveling or staying up all night
and watching the sunrise.

1117
01:21:08,370 --> 01:21:10,778
And I knew those were special moments.

1118
01:21:11,623 --> 01:21:13,995
But something was always wrong.

1119
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:17,201
I wished I'd been with someone else.

1120
01:21:18,797 --> 01:21:21,252
I knew that what I was feeling...

1121
01:21:21,341 --> 01:21:25,255
exactly what was so important to me,
they didn't understand.

1122
01:21:30,057 --> 01:21:32,346
But I'm happy to be with you.

1123
01:21:34,770 --> 01:21:37,344
You couldn't possibly know
why a night like this...

1124
01:21:37,439 --> 01:21:40,974
is so important to my life right now,
but it is.

1125
01:21:44,655 --> 01:21:48,320
- This is a great morning.
- It is a great morning.

1126
01:21:51,286 --> 01:21:54,038
Do you think we'll have others like this?

1127
01:21:55,749 --> 01:21:58,998
- What?
- What about our rational, adult decision?

1128
01:21:59,586 --> 01:22:00,914
Oh, yeah.

1129
01:22:05,883 --> 01:22:09,169
I know what you mean
about wishing somebody wasn't there.

1130
01:22:10,095 --> 01:22:14,425
It's just, usually it's myself
that I wish I could get away from.

1131
01:22:14,516 --> 01:22:16,639
Seriously, think about this.

1132
01:22:17,561 --> 01:22:20,977
I have never been anywhere
that I haven't been.

1133
01:22:22,149 --> 01:22:26,360
I've never had a kiss
when I wasn't one of the kissers.

1134
01:22:26,903 --> 01:22:31,814
You know, I've never gone to the movies
when I wasn't there in the audience.

1135
01:22:32,492 --> 01:22:36,869
I've never been out bowling
if I wasn't there making some stupid joke.

1136
01:22:36,954 --> 01:22:40,039
I think that's why so many people
hate themselves. Seriously.

1137
01:22:40,124 --> 01:22:44,418
It's just that they are sick to death
of being around themselves.

1138
01:22:45,504 --> 01:22:48,624
Let's say that you and I were together
all the time.

1139
01:22:49,383 --> 01:22:51,956
You'd start to hate
a lot of my mannerisms.

1140
01:22:52,135 --> 01:22:56,382
The way that every time
that we would have people over...

1141
01:22:57,599 --> 01:23:00,553
I'd be insecure,
and I'd get a little too drunk.

1142
01:23:00,685 --> 01:23:05,146
Or the way I tell the same stupid,
pseudo-intellectual story...

1143
01:23:05,231 --> 01:23:06,939
again and again.

1144
01:23:09,027 --> 01:23:11,482
You see, I've heard all those stories...

1145
01:23:11,571 --> 01:23:13,978
so of course I'm sick of myself.

1146
01:23:18,369 --> 01:23:20,242
But being with you...

1147
01:23:22,039 --> 01:23:24,956
it's made me feel
like I was somebody else.

1148
01:23:26,335 --> 01:23:30,166
I mean, the only other way
to lose yourself like that is...

1149
01:23:31,298 --> 01:23:34,713
you know, dancing, or alcohol...

1150
01:23:36,511 --> 01:23:38,883
or drugs, or stuff like that.

1151
01:23:41,891 --> 01:23:43,171
Fucking.

1152
01:23:44,811 --> 01:23:47,136
Fucking, yeah. That's one way.

1153
01:24:01,868 --> 01:24:03,660
Do you know what I want?

1154
01:24:04,830 --> 01:24:05,944
What?

1155
01:24:09,501 --> 01:24:10,995
To be kissed.

1156
01:24:14,422 --> 01:24:16,331
Well, I could do that.

1157
01:24:29,937 --> 01:24:31,016
Wait.

1158
01:24:35,025 --> 01:24:37,350
I have to say something stupid.

1159
01:24:38,904 --> 01:24:39,983
All right.

1160
01:24:41,531 --> 01:24:43,191
It's very stupid.

1161
01:24:46,244 --> 01:24:48,651
I don't think we should sleep together.

1162
01:24:50,415 --> 01:24:54,578
I want to, but since we're never
going to see each other again...

1163
01:24:55,419 --> 01:24:57,376
it'll make me feel bad.

1164
01:24:58,172 --> 01:25:00,959
I'll wonder who else you're with.
I'll miss you.

1165
01:25:06,346 --> 01:25:11,055
I know. It's not very adult.
Maybe it's a female thing. I can't help it.

1166
01:25:12,394 --> 01:25:14,552
Let's see each other again.

1167
01:25:16,981 --> 01:25:20,730
No, I don't want you to break our vow
just so you can get laid.

1168
01:25:21,069 --> 01:25:24,983
I don't want to just get laid.
I want to, I mean...

1169
01:25:25,948 --> 01:25:28,071
I mean, I think we should.

1170
01:25:29,243 --> 01:25:31,532
We die in the morning, right?

1171
01:25:32,830 --> 01:25:35,747
- I think we should.
- Then it's like some male fantasy.

1172
01:25:35,833 --> 01:25:39,118
Meet a French girl on the train,
fuck her and never see her again.

1173
01:25:39,211 --> 01:25:42,212
And have this story to tell.
I don't want to be a great story.

1174
01:25:42,297 --> 01:25:45,333
I don't want this great evening
to just have been for that.

1175
01:25:46,676 --> 01:25:50,176
Okay, we don't have to have sex.
It's not a big deal.

1176
01:26:01,107 --> 01:26:03,265
You don't want to see me again?

1177
01:26:04,443 --> 01:26:05,606
No, of course I do.

1178
01:26:05,694 --> 01:26:08,529
If somebody gave me
the choice right now...

1179
01:26:08,614 --> 01:26:11,283
of to never see you again,
or to marry you...

1180
01:26:11,909 --> 01:26:15,574
I would marry you.
Maybe that's a lot of romantic bullshit...

1181
01:26:15,662 --> 01:26:18,580
but people have gotten married
for a lot less.

1182
01:26:21,877 --> 01:26:23,039
Actually...

1183
01:26:24,713 --> 01:26:29,208
I think I decided I wanted to sleep
with you when we got off the train.

1184
01:26:32,970 --> 01:26:36,137
Now that we've talked so much,
I don't know anymore.

1185
01:26:46,733 --> 01:26:49,189
Why do we make everything
so complicated?

1186
01:26:49,278 --> 01:26:50,736
I don't know.

1187
01:27:52,588 --> 01:27:56,372
What's the first thing you'll do
when you get back to Paris?

1188
01:27:56,800 --> 01:27:59,208
Call my parents. What about you?

1189
01:28:00,262 --> 01:28:04,555
I don't know. I'll probably go
pick up my dog. He's with a friend.

1190
01:28:04,641 --> 01:28:06,432
You have a dog? I love dogs.

1191
01:28:06,518 --> 01:28:07,798
- You do?
- Yeah.

1192
01:28:08,186 --> 01:28:09,846
- Oh, shit.
- What?

1193
01:28:10,980 --> 01:28:13,553
I don't know. We're back in real time.

1194
01:28:13,983 --> 01:28:15,691
I know. I hate that.

1195
01:28:16,027 --> 01:28:17,521
What is that?

1196
01:28:19,530 --> 01:28:23,148
- Sounds like a harpsichord.
- Check that out.

1197
01:28:23,951 --> 01:28:25,694
Somebody's playing.

1198
01:28:32,584 --> 01:28:33,782
That's cool.

1199
01:28:52,228 --> 01:28:55,431
- Can we dance to the harpsichord?
- Of course.

1200
01:28:59,943 --> 01:29:02,315
- Wow.
- What?

1201
01:29:05,282 --> 01:29:07,274
I'm gonna take your picture...

1202
01:29:08,285 --> 01:29:09,993
so I never forget you...

1203
01:29:10,996 --> 01:29:13,569
or all this.

1204
01:29:14,541 --> 01:29:16,035
Okay, me, too.

1205
01:30:14,639 --> 01:30:17,973
"The years shall run like rabbits"

1206
01:30:20,645 --> 01:30:21,808
What?

1207
01:30:23,857 --> 01:30:25,232
Nothing.

1208
01:30:27,068 --> 01:30:31,196
I have this recording of Dylan Thomas...

1209
01:30:31,781 --> 01:30:36,074
reading a W. H. Auden poem.
He's got a great voice.

1210
01:30:38,495 --> 01:30:39,990
It's like:

1211
01:30:41,123 --> 01:30:43,365
"All the clocks in the city

1212
01:30:43,500 --> 01:30:45,623
"began to whir and chime:

1213
01:30:46,628 --> 01:30:49,036
“O let not Time deceive you

1214
01:30:49,297 --> 01:30:51,290
“you cannot conquer Time

1215
01:30:52,175 --> 01:30:54,381
“In headaches and in worry

1216
01:30:54,844 --> 01:30:56,920
“vaguely life leaks away

1217
01:30:57,847 --> 01:30:59,970
“And Time will have his fancy

1218
01:31:00,141 --> 01:31:02,299
“Tomorrow or today”

1219
01:31:03,436 --> 01:31:05,179
Something like that.

1220
01:31:06,105 --> 01:31:07,350
That's good.

1221
01:31:14,780 --> 01:31:18,445
When you talked earlier
about after a few years...

1222
01:31:18,825 --> 01:31:21,530
how a couple would begin
to hate each other...

1223
01:31:21,703 --> 01:31:25,914
by anticipating their reactions,
or getting tired of their mannerisms.

1224
01:31:26,583 --> 01:31:29,418
I think it would be the opposite for me.

1225
01:31:30,128 --> 01:31:34,339
I think I can really fall in love
when I know everything about someone.

1226
01:31:35,758 --> 01:31:39,803
The way he's gonna part his hair,
which shirt he's gonna wear that day...

1227
01:31:39,887 --> 01:31:43,505
knowing the exact story he'd tell
in a given situation.

1228
01:31:45,851 --> 01:31:49,018
I'm sure that's when I know
I'm really in love.

1229
01:32:09,957 --> 01:32:11,866
- Hey, guess what.
- What?

1230
01:32:12,752 --> 01:32:14,910
We didn't go to those guys' play.

1231
01:32:15,004 --> 01:32:16,284
- Play?
- Yeah.

1232
01:32:16,380 --> 01:32:17,661
- The cow?
- Yeah.

1233
01:32:17,756 --> 01:32:19,500
Oh, yeah, we didn't.

1234
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:21,591
Oh, no. We missed it.

1235
01:32:47,785 --> 01:32:49,612
You know what bus
to take to the airport?

1236
01:32:49,703 --> 01:32:50,866
No problem.

1237
01:32:50,955 --> 01:32:54,074
- I should get on this one.
- Right here. You wanna get on there?

1238
01:32:58,170 --> 01:33:00,495
- I guess this is it, no?
- Yeah.

1239
01:33:01,423 --> 01:33:02,882
I really...

1240
01:33:08,722 --> 01:33:11,010
- You know...
- Yeah, I know. Me, too.

1241
01:33:17,772 --> 01:33:20,938
Have a great life.
Have fun with everything you're gonna do.

1242
01:33:21,025 --> 01:33:23,942
- Good luck with school and all that.
- Okay.

1243
01:33:24,904 --> 01:33:26,362
I hate this.

1244
01:33:27,364 --> 01:33:30,069
Me, too. The train is about to leave.

1245
01:33:37,666 --> 01:33:42,327
You know all this bullshit we're talking
about not seeing each other again?

1246
01:33:42,420 --> 01:33:44,627
- I don't want that.
- I don't want to, either.

1247
01:33:44,714 --> 01:33:46,505
- You don't?
- I waited for you to say it.

1248
01:33:46,591 --> 01:33:48,215
Why didn't you say something?

1249
01:33:48,301 --> 01:33:52,298
- I was afraid you didn't wanna see me.
- All right, what do you wanna do?

1250
01:33:54,098 --> 01:33:56,933
Maybe we should meet here
in five years or something.

1251
01:33:57,017 --> 01:33:58,975
Five years? That's a long time.

1252
01:33:59,061 --> 01:34:01,896
It's awful.
It's like a sociological experiment.

1253
01:34:02,398 --> 01:34:04,935
- How about one year?
- One year. All right.

1254
01:34:05,234 --> 01:34:07,392
- How about six months?
- Six months?

1255
01:34:08,278 --> 01:34:10,152
- It's gonna be freezing.
- Yeah.

1256
01:34:10,238 --> 01:34:12,908
Who cares? We come here,
we go somewhere else.

1257
01:34:16,244 --> 01:34:18,402
Six months from now or last night?

1258
01:34:19,873 --> 01:34:24,166
Last night. Six months from last night,
which was June 16.

1259
01:34:24,252 --> 01:34:28,748
So track nine,
six months from now at 6:00 at night.

1260
01:34:29,632 --> 01:34:30,877
December.

1261
01:34:31,175 --> 01:34:34,129
It's a train ride for you,
but I gotta fly all the way here.

1262
01:34:34,220 --> 01:34:35,844
But I'm gonna be here.

1263
01:34:36,096 --> 01:34:38,303
- Okay, me, too.
- All right.

1264
01:34:40,475 --> 01:34:43,049
- We won't call, write or...
- No, it's depressing.

1265
01:34:43,145 --> 01:34:45,102
- Yeah, okay.
- All right.

1266
01:34:47,065 --> 01:34:49,852
Your train's gonna leave. Say goodbye.

1267
01:34:51,319 --> 01:34:52,434
Bye.

1268
01:34:53,530 --> 01:34:54,728
Goodbye.

1269
01:34:55,615 --> 01:34:56,895
Au revoïr.

1270
01:34:58,576 --> 01:34:59,774
Later.

1270
01:35:00,305 --> 01:35:06,934
