00:00:55,588 --> 00:00:58,785
There are some fish
that cannot be caught.

3
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:03,954
It's not that they're faster
or stronger than other fish.

4
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:07,293
They're just touched
by something extra.

5
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:11,230
One such fish was The Beast.

6
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:16,967
And by the time I was born
he was already a legend.

7
00:01:17,143 --> 00:01:21,739
He'd passed up more $ 1 00 lures
than any fish in Alabama.

8
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:25,908
Some said that fish was
the ghost of a thief...

9
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:29,283
... who'd drowned in that river
60 years before.

10
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:35,489
Others claimed he was a dinosaur
left over from the "Cruaceous" Period.

11
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:39,496
I didn't put any stock into
such speculation or superstition.

12
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:42,362
All I knew was I'd been trying
to catch that fish...

13
00:01:42,535 --> 00:01:45,026
...since I was a boy
no bigger than you.

14
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:48,039
And on the day you were born....

15
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:51,177
Well, that was the day
I finally caught him.

16
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:54,876
Now, I'd tried everything on it:

17
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:58,882
Worms, lures, peanut butter,
peanut butter and cheese.

18
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:01,646
But on that day I had a revelation:

19
00:02:01,821 --> 00:02:06,656
If that fish was Henry Walls' ghost,
then the usual bait wasn't gonna work.

20
00:02:06,826 --> 00:02:11,126
I was gonna have to use something
he truly desired.

21
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:14,693
-Your finger?
-Gold.

22
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:18,766
Now, I tied my ring onto
the strongest line they made...

23
00:02:18,938 --> 00:02:23,170
...strong enough to hold up a bridge,
they said, if only for a few minutes.

24
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:27,042
And then I cast upriver.

25
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:34,446
The Beast jumped up and grabbed it
before it even hit the water.

26
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:39,058
And just as fast,
he snapped clean through that line.

27
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:40,920
Well, you can see my predicament.

28
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:45,087
My wedding ring,
the symbol of fidelity to my wife...

29
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:47,993
-...soon to be mother of my child...
-Make him stop.

30
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:51,069
...was now lost in the gut
of an uncatchable fish.

31
00:02:51,437 --> 00:02:52,904
What did you do?

32
00:02:53,072 --> 00:02:56,371
I followed that fish upriver
and downriver.

33
00:02:58,111 --> 00:03:00,511
This fish, The Beast...

34
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:06,641
...the whole time we were calling it
a him, when in fact it was a her.

35
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:09,117
It was fat with eggs
it was gonna lay any day.

36
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:11,951
Now, I was in a situation.

37
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:15,754
I could gut that fish
and get my wedding ring back...

38
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:21,197
...but in doing so I'd be killing the
smartest catfish in the Ashton River.

39
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,801
Did I want to deprive
my son the chance...

40
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:26,996
...to catch a fish like this
of his own?

41
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:29,801
This ladyfish and l....

42
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:34,470
-Well, we had the same destiny.
-"We were part of the same equation."

43
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:37,675
Now, you may well ask...

44
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:41,581
Oh, darling, darling,
it's still your night.

45
00:03:41,754 --> 00:03:47,624
...why did it strike so quick on gold
when nothing else would attract it?

46
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:50,922
That was the lesson
I learned that day...

47
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:54,123
...the day my son was born.

48
00:03:54,300 --> 00:04:00,364
Sometimes the only way to catch
an uncatchable woman...

49
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:04,067
...is to offer her a wedding ring.

50
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:15,181
What, a father's not allowed
to talk about his son?

51
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:17,186
I'm a footnote in that story, Dad...

52
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:23,318
...the context for your great adventure,
which never happened, incidentally.

53
00:04:23,496 --> 00:04:26,659
You were selling novelty products
in Wichita when I was born.

54
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:29,427
Come on, Will.
Everyone loves that story!

55
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:33,971
They don't. I don't love that story. Not
anymore. Not after a thousand times!

56
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:38,076
I know every punch line, Dad.
I can tell them as well as you can!

57
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:41,543
For one night,
one night in your entire life...

58
00:04:41,714 --> 00:04:44,842
...the universe did not revolve
around Edward Bloom.

59
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:49,284
-How can you not understand that?
-I'm sorry to embarrass you.

60
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:53,357
You're embarrassing yourself, Dad.
You just don't see it.

61
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:59,556
After that night, I didn't speak
to my father again for three years.

62
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:09,064
William Bloom, United Press
lnternational. If I could just--

63
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:15,372
We communicated indirectly, I guess.

64
00:05:15,548 --> 00:05:19,575
In her letters and Christmas cards,
my mother wrote for both of them.

65
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:24,823
And when I'd call, she'd say Dad was
out driving or swimming in the pool.

66
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:28,017
True to form, we never
talked about not talking.

67
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:34,732
The truth is, I didn't see anything
of myself in my father.

68
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:38,234
And I don't think he saw anything
of himself in me.

69
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:45,369
We were like strangers
who knew each other very well.

70
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:52,848
In telling the story
of my father's life...

71
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:57,513
...it's impossible to separate fact
from fiction, the man from the myth.

72
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:04,160
The best I can do
is to tell it the way he told me.

73
00:06:05,898 --> 00:06:09,356
It doesn't always make sense,
and most of it never happened.

74
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:37,089
Give me back my ring!

75
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:51,000
Thank you!

76
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:54,541
But that's what kind of story this is.

77
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:06,854
His birth would set the pace
for his unlikely life.

78
00:07:07,026 --> 00:07:10,052
No longer than most men's,
but larger.

79
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:12,595
And as strange as his stories got...

80
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:16,257
... the endings were always
the most surprising of all.

81
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:45,759
Yes. Yes, he's here.

82
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:48,663
It's your mother.

83
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,506
And what does Dr. Bennett say?

84
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,709
No, sure, I'll talk to him.

85
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:04,739
Yeah, I'll wait.

86
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:06,384
It's bad?

87
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:10,682
Yeah, it's more than they thought.
They're gonna stop chemo.

88
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:14,587
-You need to go.
-Probably tonight.

89
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:18,987
-I'm going with you.
-No, no, no. You shouldn't.

90
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:20,962
I'm going with you.

91
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:52,094
Now, which one's it gonna be?

92
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:55,132
"Monkey in a Barn,"
or "Dog in the Road"?

93
00:08:55,234 --> 00:08:55,902
The one about the witch.

94
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:56,903
The one about the witch.

95
00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:57,403
The one about the witch.

96
00:08:57,904 --> 00:08:59,405
Your momma says I can't
tell you that one anymore.

97
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:00,239
Your momma says I can't
tell you that one anymore.

98
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:04,502
-You get nightmares.
-But I'm not scared.

99
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:08,804
Well, neither was l, at first.

100
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:12,216
Now, this took place
in the swamp outside of Ashton.

101
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:17,049
Children weren't allowed in the swamp
on account of the snakes, spiders...

102
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:21,853
...and quicksand that would swallow
you up before you could even scream.

103
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:24,258
There were five of us
out there that night:

104
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:28,264
Me, Ruthie, Wilbur Freely...

105
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:32,097
...and the Price Brothers,
Don and Zacky.

106
00:09:32,271 --> 00:09:36,105
And not one of us knew
what was in store.

107
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:40,874
It's common knowledge that most
towns of a certain size have a witch...

108
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:43,242
...if only to eat
misbehaving children...

109
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:46,613
...and the occasional puppy
who wanders into her yard.

110
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:49,949
Witches use those bones
to cast spells and curses...

111
00:09:50,122 --> 00:09:52,522
...and make the land infertile.

112
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:56,822
-ls it true she got a glass eye?
-I heard she got it from gypsies.

113
00:09:56,996 --> 00:09:59,191
-What's a gypsy?
-Your momma's a gypsy.

114
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:00,662
Your momma's a bitch.

115
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:03,063
You shouldn't swear.
There's ladies present.

116
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:04,463
-Shit.
-Damn.

117
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:05,695
Screw.

118
00:10:05,871 --> 00:10:07,964
Turn off your flashlights.
She'll see you!

119
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,768
Yet of all the witches in Alabama...

120
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:13,844
...there was one who was said
to be the most feared.

121
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:18,109
For she had one glass eye which
was said to contain mystical powers.

122
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:22,152
I heard if you look right at it,
you'll see how you're gonna die.

123
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:26,018
That's bull-S-H-l-T, that is.
She's not even a real witch.

124
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:28,251
If you're so sure, go get that eye.

125
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:33,023
I heard she keeps it in a box on her
night table. Or are you too scared?

126
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:35,394
I'll go in right now and get that eye.

127
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:37,627
-Then do it.
-Fine, I will.

128
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:40,772
-Fine, you do it.
-Fine, I'm doing it.

129
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,204
Edward, don't!

130
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:47,312
She'll make soap out of you.
That's what she does.

131
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,142
She makes soap out of people.

132
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:42,297
Ma'am, my name is Edward Bloom...

133
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:45,096
...and there's some folks
like to see your eye.

134
00:11:58,284 --> 00:12:00,252
-You get The Eye?
-I brought it.

135
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:01,545
Let's see it.

136
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:09,093
Whoa, help!

137
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:23,237
I saw how I was gonna die.
I was old and I fell.

138
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:26,410
I wasn't old at all.

139
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:37,484
I was thinking about death and all.
About seeing how you're gonna die.

140
00:12:37,656 --> 00:12:41,148
I mean, on one hand,
if dying was all you thought about...

141
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,189
...it could kind of screw you up.

142
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:47,093
But it could kind of help you,
couldn't it?

143
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:51,362
Because, everything else,
you'd know you could survive.

144
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:57,267
I guess I'm saying I'd like to know.

145
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:10,752
That's how I go.

146
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:34,472
Hi, Mom.

147
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:45,620
-ls that Dr. Bennett's car?
-Yes. He's up with your father now.

148
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:49,483
-And how is he?
-Well-- No, I got it.

149
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:53,723
He's impossible. He won't eat.
Because he doesn't eat, he's weaker.

150
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:55,992
Because he's weak,
he doesn't want to eat.

151
00:13:56,168 --> 00:14:01,037
-How much time does he have left?
-You don't talk about that.

152
00:14:01,373 --> 00:14:02,897
Not yet.

153
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:06,101
Will.

154
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:10,171
Dr. Bennett. Oh, it's good to see you.

155
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:12,909
My wife, Josephine.

156
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:15,118
A pleasure.

157
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:19,484
-You're seven months.
-To the day!

158
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:22,755
It's a boy.

159
00:14:25,497 --> 00:14:31,094
Try to get him to drink one of these.
He won't, but go ahead and try.

160
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:18,278
Dad?

161
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:31,892
You want some water?

162
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:52,539
-You are in for a surprise.
-Am l?

163
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:55,651
Having a kid changes everything.

164
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:59,587
There's the diapers and the burping
and the midnight feeding.

165
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:02,750
-Did you do any of that?
-No.

166
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:05,386
But I hear it's terrible.

167
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:10,995
Then you spend years trying
to corrupt and mislead this child...

168
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:15,971
...fill its head with nonsense,
and still it turns out perfectly fine.

169
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:21,105
-You think I'm up for it?
-You learned from the best.

170
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,885
Drink half the can.
I'll tell Mom you drank it all.

171
00:16:28,053 --> 00:16:29,611
Everyone wins.

172
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:34,057
People needn't worry so much.
It's not my time yet.

173
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:36,194
This is not how I go.

174
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:40,560
-Really?
-Truly. I saw it in The Eye.

175
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:44,533
-The old lady by the swamp?
-She was a witch.

176
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:47,365
No, she was old and probably senile.

177
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:52,704
I saw my death in that eye,
and this isn't how it happens.

178
00:16:52,878 --> 00:16:54,937
So how does it happen?

179
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:59,676
Surprise ending.
Wouldn't want to ruin it for you.

180
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:03,720
Your mother thought
we wouldn't talk again.

181
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:06,687
Look at us. We're talking fine.

182
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,724
We're storytellers, both of us.

183
00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:14,389
I speak mine out,
you write yours down. Same thing.

184
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:17,495
Dad....

185
00:17:20,272 --> 00:17:22,900
I hope to talk about some things
while I'm here.

186
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:25,270
You mean while I'm here.

187
00:17:25,744 --> 00:17:29,475
I just want to know
the true versions of things:

188
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:32,446
Events. Stories.

189
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:33,979
You.

190
00:17:45,697 --> 00:17:48,291
Your mother hasn't been
keeping up the pool.

191
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:52,130
-lf you wanted to, you could fix it.
-Yeah, I will.

192
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:55,569
-You know where the chemicals are?
-I did it when you were gone.

193
00:17:55,741 --> 00:18:01,737
I was never much for being
at home, Will. Too confining.

194
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:04,977
And this here, being stuck in bed....

195
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:08,676
Dying is the worst thing
that's ever happened to me.

196
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:15,287
-I thought you said you weren't dying.
-I said this isn't how I go.

197
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:19,363
The last part is much more unusual.

198
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:21,863
Trust me on that.

199
00:18:54,766 --> 00:18:57,735
Dr. Bennett said I have
to stay at home for a week.

200
00:18:57,903 --> 00:19:01,600
Oh, that's nothing. Once,
I had to stay in bed for three years.

201
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:05,004
-Did you have the chickenpox?
-I wish.

202
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:27,226
Truth is, no one quite knew
what was wrong.

203
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:30,057
Most times a person
grows up gradually...

204
00:19:30,235 --> 00:19:32,601
...while I found myself in a hurry.

205
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:40,005
My muscles and my bones couldn't
keep up with my body's ambition.

206
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:43,637
So I spent the better part
of three years confined to my bed...

207
00:19:43,815 --> 00:19:47,751
... with the encyclopedia being
my only means of exploration.

208
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,911
I had made it all the way to the G's...

209
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:52,989
...hoping to find an answer
to my "gigantificationism"...

210
00:19:53,158 --> 00:19:56,992
... when I uncovered an article
about the common goldfish.

211
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:01,098
"Kept in a small bowl,
the goldfish will remain small.

212
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:02,597
With more space...

213
00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:06,602
...the fish will grow double, triple,
or quadruple its size."

214
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:10,037
It occurred to me then that perhaps
the reason for my growth...

215
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,734
...was that I was intended
for larger things.

216
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:16,472
After all, a giant man can't have
an ordinary-sized life.

217
00:20:18,016 --> 00:20:21,281
As soon as my bones had settled
in their adult configuration...

218
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:26,254
...I set upon my plan to make
a bigger place for myself in Ashton.

219
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:27,687
Tigers, go!

220
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:44,904
Edward Bloom!

221
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:31,780
Doggy! My doggy!
My doggy's trapped!

222
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:44,029
I was the biggest thing
Ashton had ever seen.

223
00:21:44,836 --> 00:21:47,828
Until one day, a stranger arrived.

224
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:07,718
Calm down. Calm down, everybody.
Calm down. That's enough.

225
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:11,659
-Mr. Mayor, he ate an entire corn field.
-He ate my dog.

226
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,424
If you ain't gonna stop him, mayor,
we will.

227
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:17,659
I won't have mob violence
in this town.

228
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:19,770
Now, has someone tried
talking to him?

229
00:22:19,938 --> 00:22:22,566
-You can't reason with him.
-He's a monster.

230
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,536
I'll do it.

231
00:22:39,224 --> 00:22:41,556
I'll talk to him.
See if I can get him to go.

232
00:22:41,727 --> 00:22:44,127
That creature could crush you
without trying.

233
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:47,288
Oh, trust me, he'll have to try.

234
00:23:18,797 --> 00:23:20,287
Hello?

235
00:23:24,369 --> 00:23:27,896
My name is Edward Bloom,
and I wanna talk to you!

236
00:23:28,707 --> 00:23:31,073
Go away!

237
00:23:32,978 --> 00:23:36,038
Now, I'm not going anywhere
until you show yourself!

238
00:23:36,214 --> 00:23:39,206
I said, go away!

239
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:02,038
Armed with the foreknowledge
of my own death...

240
00:24:02,207 --> 00:24:04,334
...I knew the giant couldn't kill me.

241
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:09,944
All the same, I preferred to keep
my bones unbroken.

242
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:12,106
Why are you here?

243
00:24:13,418 --> 00:24:14,908
So you can eat me.

244
00:24:15,387 --> 00:24:19,323
The town decided to send
a human sacrifice and I volunteered.

245
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:23,086
My arms are a little stringy, but
there's some good eating in my legs.

246
00:24:23,261 --> 00:24:26,492
I mean, I'd be tempted
to eat them myself.

247
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:30,726
So I guess, well....

248
00:24:30,902 --> 00:24:35,168
If you'd just get it over with quick,
because I'm not much for pain, really.

249
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:51,349
Oh, come on! I can't go back!
I'm a human sacrifice!

250
00:24:51,523 --> 00:24:54,048
If I go back,
they'll think I'm a coward.

251
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:56,820
I'd rather be dinner than a coward.

252
00:24:57,429 --> 00:24:58,657
Here.

253
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:02,258
You can start with my hand.
It'll be an appetizer.

254
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:06,564
I don't want to eat you.
I don't want to eat anybody.

255
00:25:06,738 --> 00:25:10,868
I just get so hungry.
I'm just too big.

256
00:25:12,043 --> 00:25:14,841
Did you ever think that
maybe you're not too big...

257
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:17,140
...but maybe this town
is just too small?

258
00:25:17,315 --> 00:25:20,182
I've heard in real cities
there are buildings so tall...

259
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,582
...you can't even see
the tops of them.

260
00:25:22,754 --> 00:25:25,245
-Really?
-Oh, I wouldn't lie to you.

261
00:25:25,423 --> 00:25:27,550
And all-you-can-eat buffets.

262
00:25:27,726 --> 00:25:30,718
-Now, you can eat a lot, can't you?
-I can.

263
00:25:30,896 --> 00:25:33,797
So why are you wasting your time
in a small town?

264
00:25:33,965 --> 00:25:37,059
You're a big man.
You should be in a big city.

265
00:25:37,235 --> 00:25:40,432
You're just trying to get me
to leave, aren't you?

266
00:25:40,739 --> 00:25:44,266
-What's your name, giant?
-Karl.

267
00:25:44,442 --> 00:25:47,878
Well, mine's Edward.
And truthfully....

268
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:51,880
Well, I do want you to leave, Karl.
But I want to leave with you.

269
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:54,814
I mean, you think this town
is too small for you?

270
00:25:54,986 --> 00:25:58,080
Well, it's too small for a man
of my ambition.

271
00:25:58,256 --> 00:26:01,419
So, what do you say? Join me?

272
00:26:04,629 --> 00:26:05,857
Okay.

273
00:26:07,198 --> 00:26:08,688
Okay.

274
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:12,164
Now, first, we gotta
get you ready for the city.

275
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:33,186
Edward Bloom, first son of Ashton...

276
00:26:33,358 --> 00:26:36,850
...it's with a heavy heart
that we see you go.

277
00:26:37,028 --> 00:26:39,690
But take with you
this key to the city...

278
00:26:39,864 --> 00:26:42,799
...and know that any time
you want to come back...

279
00:26:42,968 --> 00:26:46,028
...all our doors are open to you.

280
00:26:54,546 --> 00:26:58,573
That afternoon as I left Ashton,
everyone seemed to have advice.

281
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:01,617
Find yourself a nice girl, now!

282
00:27:02,053 --> 00:27:05,045
Watch your pride, Edward Bloom!

283
00:27:05,256 --> 00:27:09,625
But there was one person whose
counsel I held above all others.

284
00:27:13,698 --> 00:27:16,428
She said that the biggest fish
in the river...

285
00:27:16,601 --> 00:27:19,764
...gets that way
by never being caught.

286
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:27,843
-What'd she say?
-Beats me.

287
00:27:39,691 --> 00:27:41,522
There were two roads out of Ashton:

288
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:44,594
A new one which was paved
and an older one that wasn't.

289
00:27:44,763 --> 00:27:46,754
People didn't use
the old one anymore...

290
00:27:46,931 --> 00:27:49,729
...and it had developed a reputation
for being haunted.

291
00:27:49,901 --> 00:27:53,098
Well, since I had no intention
of ever returning to Ashton...

292
00:27:53,271 --> 00:27:57,435
... this seemed as good a time as any
to find out what lay down that old one.

293
00:27:57,609 --> 00:28:02,342
-You know anyone who's taken it?
-That poet, Norther Winslow, did.

294
00:28:02,814 --> 00:28:05,282
He was going to Paris, France.

295
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:08,886
I guess he liked it.
No one ever heard from him again.

296
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,247
I'll tell you what.
You go the other way.

297
00:28:11,423 --> 00:28:14,984
I'll cut through here,
and I'll meet you on the far side.

298
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:19,288
You're just trying to run away,
aren't you?

299
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:22,227
Here.

300
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:26,629
Just to be sure, you can take my pack.

301
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:07,778
Why, you son of a--

302
00:29:33,738 --> 00:29:36,332
Now, there comes a point
when a reasonable man...

303
00:29:36,508 --> 00:29:41,275
...will swallow his pride and admit
that he's made a terrible mistake.

304
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:46,383
The truth is,
I was never a reasonable man.

305
00:29:47,552 --> 00:29:50,248
And what I recall of
Sunday school was that...

306
00:29:50,421 --> 00:29:55,518
... the more difficult something is,
the more rewarding it is in the end.

307
00:30:54,786 --> 00:30:57,550
Friend! Welcome to you!

308
00:30:57,989 --> 00:31:00,981
-What's your name?
-Edward Bloom.

309
00:31:02,093 --> 00:31:05,187
-"Bloom" like a flower?
-Yes.

310
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:09,527
Oh, here! Here you are, right here.
"Edward Bloom."

311
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:12,033
We weren't expecting you yet.

312
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:14,296
-You were expecting me?
-Not yet.

313
00:31:14,472 --> 00:31:19,136
-You must've taken a shortcut.
-Why, yes, I did. It almost killed me.

314
00:31:19,644 --> 00:31:23,774
Life will do that to you.
And truthfully, the long way is easier.

315
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:27,082
-But it's longer.
-Much longer.

316
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:30,187
And you're here now,
and that's what matters.

317
00:31:30,355 --> 00:31:31,583
What is this place?

318
00:31:31,756 --> 00:31:35,021
The town of Spectre.
Best-kept secret in Alabama!

319
00:31:35,193 --> 00:31:38,560
Now, it says here
you're from Ashton, right?

320
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:42,063
Last person we had from Ashton
was Norther Winslow.

321
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:44,167
The poet?
Whatever happened to him?

322
00:31:44,335 --> 00:31:48,704
He's still here. Let me buy you a drink.
I'll tell you all about it.

323
00:31:48,873 --> 00:31:50,807
Hell, I'll have him tell you!

324
00:31:50,975 --> 00:31:54,103
I have to meet somebody,
and I'm already running late.

325
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:58,181
Now, son, I already told you.
You're early.

326
00:32:32,684 --> 00:32:35,812
Now, tell me if that isn't
the best pie you ever ate.

327
00:32:35,987 --> 00:32:37,682
It truly is.

328
00:32:42,026 --> 00:32:45,962
Well, everything tastes better here.
Even the water is sweet.

329
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:51,731
Never gets too hot,
too cold, too humid.

330
00:32:52,236 --> 00:32:55,433
At night, the wind goes through
the trees where you'd swear...

331
00:32:55,606 --> 00:32:58,973
...there was a whole symphony
out there playing just for you.

332
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,970
Hey! Jenny!

333
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,780
Come back here!

334
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:13,889
Jenny!

335
00:33:29,474 --> 00:33:31,237
Hey, I need those.

336
00:33:31,743 --> 00:33:35,110
-There is no softer ground than town.
-That almost rhymes.

337
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,770
He's our poet laureate. Come on.

338
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:44,811
I agreed to spend the afternoon,
if only to understand...

339
00:33:44,989 --> 00:33:49,858
...the mystery of how a place could
feel so strange and yet so familiar.

340
00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:56,325
I've been working on this poem
for 1 2 years.

341
00:33:56,501 --> 00:33:58,093
Really?

342
00:33:58,269 --> 00:34:03,070
There's a lot of expectation.
I don't wanna disappoint my fans.

343
00:34:03,975 --> 00:34:05,636
May l?

344
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:27,558
It's only three lines long.

345
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:34,133
This is why you should never show
a work in progress.

346
00:35:29,827 --> 00:35:31,795
I got him!

347
00:35:47,411 --> 00:35:49,072
There's leeches in there.

348
00:35:50,014 --> 00:35:53,040
-Did you see that woman?
-What did she look like?

349
00:35:53,217 --> 00:35:56,675
-Well, she was....
-Was she naked?

350
00:35:59,023 --> 00:36:00,547
Yes, she was.

351
00:36:00,725 --> 00:36:04,991
It's not a woman. It's a fish.
No one ever catches her.

352
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,654
Fish looks different
to different people.

353
00:36:07,965 --> 00:36:11,765
My daddy said it looked like the
coon dog he had when he was a kid...

354
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,661
...back from the dead.

355
00:36:18,075 --> 00:36:19,940
Oh, darn.

356
00:36:21,879 --> 00:36:24,109
-How old are you?
-Eighteen.

357
00:36:24,282 --> 00:36:28,184
I'm 8. That means when I'm 1 8,
you'll be 28.

358
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:33,119
-And when I'm 28, you'll only be 38.
-You're pretty good at arithmetic.

359
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:37,785
And when I'm 38, you'll be 48.
That's not much difference at all.

360
00:36:37,962 --> 00:36:40,760
Sure is a lot now, though, huh?

361
00:37:14,532 --> 00:37:17,160
Hey, Edward!

362
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:30,071
Roses are red
Violets are blue

363
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,773
I love Spectre....

364
00:37:38,522 --> 00:37:40,513
Excuse me.

365
00:37:46,697 --> 00:37:50,133
Jenny thinks you're quite a catch.
We all do.

366
00:37:50,968 --> 00:37:52,299
What?

367
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:55,701
I said, you're quite a catch.

368
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:19,725
I have to leave.

369
00:38:23,768 --> 00:38:25,133
Tonight.

370
00:38:25,603 --> 00:38:26,865
Why?

371
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:30,764
This town is more than any man
could ask for.

372
00:38:30,941 --> 00:38:34,468
And if I were to end up here,
I would consider myself lucky.

373
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:38,547
But the truth is, I'm just not ready
to end up anywhere.

374
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,845
But no one's ever left.

375
00:38:42,086 --> 00:38:45,419
How are you gonna make it
without your shoes?

376
00:38:45,589 --> 00:38:48,217
Well, I suspect it will hurt. A lot.

377
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:54,825
Now, I'm sorry, but....
Well, goodbye.

378
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:02,165
-You won't find a better place.
-I don't expect to.

379
00:39:07,311 --> 00:39:09,336
Promise me you'll come back.

380
00:39:10,815 --> 00:39:15,616
I promise. Someday.
When I'm really supposed to.

381
00:39:46,584 --> 00:39:49,417
That night,
I reached two conclusions.

382
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:55,249
The first was that a dangerous path
is made much worse by darkness.

383
00:39:55,426 --> 00:40:00,159
The second was that I was
hopelessly and irrevocably lost.

384
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:03,723
These woods would become
my graveyard.

385
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:10,873
As difficult as it was to reach Spectre,
I was fated to get there eventually.

386
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:14,442
After all, no man can avoid
reaching the end of his life.

387
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:33,359
And then I realized
this wasn't the end of my life.

388
00:40:33,531 --> 00:40:36,523
This isn't how I die.

389
00:40:54,018 --> 00:40:55,349
Friend.

390
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:59,455
-What happened to your shoes?
-They kind of got ahead of me.

391
00:41:16,373 --> 00:41:19,399
I don't know if you saw it,
but Josephine had some photos...

392
00:41:19,577 --> 00:41:21,135
...in the most recent Newsweek.

393
00:41:23,681 --> 00:41:25,171
Really?

394
00:41:25,349 --> 00:41:26,680
That's just wonderful.

395
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:33,013
I spent a week in Morocco
for the story. It was incredible.

396
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:37,650
Oh. We'll have to pick up a copy.

397
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:51,065
I don't know if you're aware of this,
Josephine...

398
00:41:51,542 --> 00:41:56,707
...but African parrots, in their native
Congo, they speak only French.

399
00:41:57,815 --> 00:41:59,077
Really?

400
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:02,982
You're lucky to get four words
out of them in English.

401
00:42:03,153 --> 00:42:06,054
But if you were to walk
through the jungle...

402
00:42:06,223 --> 00:42:09,920
...you'd hear them speaking
the most elaborate French.

403
00:42:10,628 --> 00:42:15,759
Those parrots talk about everything.
Politics, movies, fashion.

404
00:42:15,933 --> 00:42:18,629
Everything but religion.

405
00:42:19,737 --> 00:42:21,068
Why not religion, Dad?

406
00:42:21,772 --> 00:42:26,436
It's rude to talk about religion. You
never know who you're gonna offend.

407
00:42:31,782 --> 00:42:34,979
Josephine actually went
to the Congo last year.

408
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:38,679
Oh, so you know.

409
00:42:54,338 --> 00:42:56,772
Hello.

410
00:42:56,941 --> 00:42:59,307
Hi. How are you feeling?

411
00:43:00,277 --> 00:43:03,610
Oh, I was dreaming.

412
00:43:04,148 --> 00:43:06,639
What were you dreaming about?

413
00:43:07,718 --> 00:43:10,744
Oh, I don't usually remember...

414
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:15,255
...unless they're especially portentous.
Do you know what that word means?

415
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:18,687
It means when you dream about
something that's gonna happen.

416
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:21,921
Like one night, I had a dream...

417
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:26,866
...where this crow came and said:

418
00:43:27,037 --> 00:43:29,528
"Your aunt is gonna die."

419
00:43:30,708 --> 00:43:33,939
I was so scared,
I woke up my parents...

420
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:38,343
...but they said it was just a dream
and to get back to bed.

421
00:43:38,515 --> 00:43:42,007
But the next morning,
my Aunt Stacy was dead.

422
00:43:42,386 --> 00:43:44,354
That's terrible.

423
00:43:44,521 --> 00:43:49,652
Terrible for her, but think about me,
young boy with that kind of power.

424
00:43:50,227 --> 00:43:54,960
Wasn't three weeks later when the
crow came back to me in a dream...

425
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:59,831
...and said, "Your daddy's gonna die."

426
00:44:00,671 --> 00:44:02,730
I didn't know what to do.

427
00:44:03,107 --> 00:44:06,770
I finally told my father, but he said:

428
00:44:06,944 --> 00:44:12,780
"Oh, not to worry."
But I could see he was rattled.

429
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:15,783
The next morning, he wasn't himself.

430
00:44:15,953 --> 00:44:20,549
Kept looking around, waiting for
something to drop on his head.

431
00:44:20,724 --> 00:44:25,821
Because the crow didn't say how it
was gonna happen, just those words:

432
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:28,226
"Your daddy's gonna die."

433
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:34,737
Well, he left home early
and was gone a long time.

434
00:44:34,905 --> 00:44:37,635
When he finally came back,
he looked terrible...

435
00:44:37,808 --> 00:44:41,073
...Iike he was waiting
for the ax to fall all day.

436
00:44:42,112 --> 00:44:43,875
He said to my mother:

437
00:44:44,048 --> 00:44:47,814
"I've just had the worst day of my life."

438
00:44:47,985 --> 00:44:51,978
"You think you've had a bad day?"
she said.

439
00:44:52,156 --> 00:44:57,287
"This morning, the milkman
dropped dead on the porch."

440
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:03,628
Because, see, my mother
was banging the milkman.

441
00:45:05,436 --> 00:45:10,100
-Can I take your picture?
-Oh, you don't need a picture.

442
00:45:10,274 --> 00:45:14,472
Just look up the word "handsome"
in the dictionary.

443
00:45:14,645 --> 00:45:15,976
Please?

444
00:45:17,614 --> 00:45:19,081
All right.

445
00:45:22,486 --> 00:45:24,545
I have photos of the wedding
to show you.

446
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:27,156
There is a great one
of you and my father.

447
00:45:33,497 --> 00:45:38,127
I want to see pictures of your wedding.
I've never seen any.

448
00:45:38,302 --> 00:45:41,738
That's because we didn't have
a proper wedding.

449
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:45,306
Your mother-in-law was
never supposed to marry me.

450
00:45:45,476 --> 00:45:49,310
-She was engaged to somebody else.
-I never knew.

451
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:52,074
Will never told you?

452
00:45:52,683 --> 00:45:55,117
Probably just as well.

453
00:45:55,285 --> 00:45:57,913
He would have told it wrong, anyway.

454
00:45:58,088 --> 00:46:01,285
All the facts, none of the flavor.

455
00:46:01,458 --> 00:46:05,121
Oh. So this is a tall tale.

456
00:46:05,996 --> 00:46:09,454
Well, it's not a short one.

457
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:12,770
I'd just left Spectre and was
on my way to discover my destiny.

458
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:13,771
I'd just left Spectre and was
on my way to discover my destiny.

459
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:14,271
I'd just left Spectre and was
on my way to discover my destiny.

460
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:14,972
I'd just left Spectre and was
on my way to discover my destiny.

461
00:46:14,972 --> 00:46:16,872
I'd just left Spectre and was
on my way to discover my destiny.

462
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:19,804
Not knowing what
that would be exactly...

463
00:46:19,977 --> 00:46:24,914
...I explored every opportunity
that presented itself.

464
00:46:53,777 --> 00:46:58,043
Coco! Coco! There they are.

465
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:02,717
Ladies and gentlemen!

466
00:47:02,886 --> 00:47:06,652
You may think
you've seen the unusual.

467
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:11,825
You may think you've seen the bizarre.

468
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:17,998
But I've traveled
to the five corners of the world...

469
00:47:18,368 --> 00:47:24,864
...and let me tell you,
I've never seen anything like this!

470
00:47:30,314 --> 00:47:32,339
When I met this man...

471
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:35,212
...he was picking oranges in Florida.

472
00:47:35,385 --> 00:47:39,412
His fellow workers called him
El Penumbra. "The Shadow."

473
00:47:41,391 --> 00:47:43,791
Because when you worked
beside him...

474
00:47:44,328 --> 00:47:46,592
...he blocked out the daylight!

475
00:47:47,297 --> 00:47:51,358
Not to alarm you, ma'am,
but if this man wanted to...

476
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:55,995
...he could crush your head
between his toes...

477
00:47:56,173 --> 00:47:59,700
...Iike a tiny walnut.
But he won't do it.

478
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:02,437
No. No, ladies and gentlemen...

479
00:48:02,613 --> 00:48:04,740
...he will not hurt her...

480
00:48:05,048 --> 00:48:08,609
...because he is our own gentle giant.

481
00:48:09,953 --> 00:48:16,119
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you Colossus!

482
00:49:40,677 --> 00:49:44,306
Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls...

483
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:46,847
...thank y'all for coming.

484
00:49:47,017 --> 00:49:50,578
Drive home safely, everyone.
Thank you for coming.

485
00:49:51,088 --> 00:49:54,751
It was on that night
Karl met his destiny.

486
00:49:55,025 --> 00:49:58,426
And I met mine, almost.

487
00:49:58,595 --> 00:50:03,430
They say when you meet
the love of your life, time stops.

488
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:05,090
And that's true.

489
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:53,408
What they don't tell you
is that once time starts again...

490
00:50:54,151 --> 00:50:57,917
...it moves extra fast to catch up.

491
00:51:30,787 --> 00:51:32,186
What's your name?

492
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:37,390
-It's Karl.
-Karl.

493
00:51:42,866 --> 00:51:48,395
T ell me, Karl, have you ever heard
the term "involuntary servitude"?

494
00:51:48,572 --> 00:51:51,439
-No.
-"Unconscionable contract"?

495
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:56,477
-Nope.
-Great.

496
00:51:56,646 --> 00:51:58,705
Here you go.

497
00:51:59,850 --> 00:52:01,545
Here you are.

498
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:07,552
Mr. Soggybottom,
come down this here...

499
00:52:07,724 --> 00:52:10,022
...so he can use your back
to sign on it.

500
00:52:22,172 --> 00:52:25,039
Okay. Thank you. Yeah.

501
00:52:26,343 --> 00:52:28,277
Hey, kid.

502
00:52:28,445 --> 00:52:31,812
-Your friend just made himself a star.
-Oh, that's great.

503
00:52:34,117 --> 00:52:36,779
-My attorney, Mr. Soggybottom.
-Good to meet you.

504
00:52:36,953 --> 00:52:38,614
Pleased to meet you.

505
00:52:43,727 --> 00:52:46,821
What's the matter? I haven't
seen a customer so depressed...

506
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:50,262
...since the elephant sat
on that farmer's wife.

507
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:53,662
"Depressed"?

508
00:52:55,238 --> 00:52:57,706
See? The big guy likes it.

509
00:52:58,508 --> 00:53:00,567
I just saw the woman I'm gonna marry.

510
00:53:00,744 --> 00:53:03,872
I know it. But I lost her.

511
00:53:04,981 --> 00:53:06,312
Oh, tough break.

512
00:53:06,483 --> 00:53:10,351
Well, most men have to get married
before they lose their wives.

513
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:15,617
I'm gonna spend the rest of my life
looking for her. That or die alone.

514
00:53:15,992 --> 00:53:17,857
Damn, kid.

515
00:53:21,097 --> 00:53:23,463
Let me guess. Real pretty?

516
00:53:24,768 --> 00:53:26,633
Reddish-blondish hair?

517
00:53:28,405 --> 00:53:29,770
Blue dress?

518
00:53:31,141 --> 00:53:32,802
Yeah!

519
00:53:32,976 --> 00:53:35,968
I know her uncle. Friends of the family.

520
00:53:36,146 --> 00:53:38,239
Who is she? Where does she live?

521
00:53:38,415 --> 00:53:41,282
Forget it. Don't waste your time.
She's out of your league.

522
00:53:41,451 --> 00:53:44,943
-What? You don't even know me.
-Sure I do.

523
00:53:45,121 --> 00:53:49,581
You were hot shit back in Hickville, but
here in the real world, you got squat.

524
00:53:49,759 --> 00:53:51,693
You don't have a plan or a job.

525
00:53:51,861 --> 00:53:54,329
Nothing except the clothes
on your back.

526
00:53:54,798 --> 00:53:57,699
Well, I have a whole backpack
full of clothes.

527
00:53:58,835 --> 00:54:01,599
Oh, someone stole my backpack.

528
00:54:02,372 --> 00:54:06,331
You were a big fish in a small pond,
but this here is the ocean...

529
00:54:06,509 --> 00:54:09,069
...and you're drowning.
Go back to Puddleville.

530
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:12,682
-You'll be happy there.
-You say I don't have a plan. I do.

531
00:54:12,849 --> 00:54:16,444
I'll find that girl, marry her,
and spend the rest of my life with her.

532
00:54:16,987 --> 00:54:20,718
I don't have a job, but I would
have a job if you gave me one.

533
00:54:20,890 --> 00:54:22,915
And I may not have much...

534
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:26,790
...but I have more determination
than any man you're likely to meet.

535
00:54:29,032 --> 00:54:32,661
I'm sorry, kid. I don't do charity.
Come on, big boy.

536
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:36,070
Wait. Look, I'll work
night and day for you...

537
00:54:36,239 --> 00:54:38,002
...and you won't have to pay me.

538
00:54:40,010 --> 00:54:43,002
You just have to tell me who she is.

539
00:54:46,516 --> 00:54:48,541
Every month you work for me...

540
00:54:48,718 --> 00:54:52,119
...I'll tell you one thing about her.
That's my final offer.

541
00:54:56,059 --> 00:54:58,289
Let's get started.

542
00:55:11,341 --> 00:55:15,334
From that moment on, I did everything
Mr. Calloway asked.

543
00:55:15,645 --> 00:55:18,614
I'd go three days
without stopping to eat.

544
00:55:18,782 --> 00:55:21,410
And four days without sleeping.

545
00:55:21,584 --> 00:55:24,451
What kept me going was
the promise of meeting the girl...

546
00:55:24,621 --> 00:55:25,883
... who would be my wife.

547
00:55:33,596 --> 00:55:36,030
Stick together, that's the way
it's gonna be.

548
00:55:36,199 --> 00:55:40,101
-The way it was, and the way it will be.
-Mr. Calloway, sir?

549
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:42,033
It's been a month today.

550
00:55:43,973 --> 00:55:47,204
This girl, the love of your life...

551
00:55:47,377 --> 00:55:52,337
...her favorite flowers are daffodils.

552
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:57,719
-So get that stuff....
-Daffodils.

553
00:55:58,455 --> 00:56:00,855
Daffodils.

554
00:56:02,425 --> 00:56:04,689
Daffodils.

555
00:56:10,767 --> 00:56:12,325
True to his word...

556
00:56:12,502 --> 00:56:15,266
...every month Amos would tell me
something new...

557
00:56:15,438 --> 00:56:17,804
...about the woman of my dreams.

558
00:56:17,974 --> 00:56:20,909
Enjoy yourselves, enjoy yourselves.

559
00:56:21,077 --> 00:56:22,567
She's going to college.

560
00:56:22,979 --> 00:56:27,245
College. She's going to college.

561
00:56:37,794 --> 00:56:39,261
She likes music.

562
00:56:39,963 --> 00:56:43,729
Music. She likes music.

563
00:56:48,004 --> 00:56:50,106
Over the months, I learned a lot
about the woman I would marry...

564
00:56:50,106 --> 00:56:50,907
Over the months, I learned a lot
about the woman I would marry...

565
00:56:50,907 --> 00:56:51,408
Over the months, I learned a lot
about the woman I would marry...

566
00:56:51,408 --> 00:56:52,409
Over the months, I learned a lot
about the woman I would marry...

567
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:55,111
...but not her name,
and not where to find her.

568
00:56:55,945 --> 00:57:00,712
That time had come.
I couldn't wait any longer.

569
00:57:11,995 --> 00:57:14,293
Mr. Calloway?

570
00:57:16,332 --> 00:57:19,631
It's Edward Bloom.
I need to talk to you.

571
00:57:23,907 --> 00:57:26,307
Mr. Calloway?

572
00:58:00,109 --> 00:58:01,474
No. Wait!

573
00:58:19,596 --> 00:58:24,192
That night, I discovered that most
things you consider evil or wicked...

574
00:58:24,367 --> 00:58:28,269
...are simply lonely and lacking
in social niceties.

575
00:59:02,672 --> 00:59:04,765
Didn't kill anything, did l?

576
00:59:05,742 --> 00:59:10,202
A few rabbits. But I think one of them
was already dead.

577
00:59:13,416 --> 00:59:16,442
That would explain the indigestion.

578
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:25,551
Thank you.

579
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:29,725
I was wrong about you, kid.

580
00:59:29,899 --> 00:59:33,300
You may not have much,
but what you got, you got a lot of.

581
00:59:33,636 --> 00:59:36,104
You could get any girl.

582
00:59:36,272 --> 00:59:38,263
There's only one I want.

583
00:59:42,979 --> 00:59:44,310
Her name...

584
00:59:47,684 --> 00:59:49,811
...is Sandra Templeton.

585
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:54,583
She goes to Auburn.

586
00:59:55,024 --> 00:59:59,358
Semester's almost over,
so you better hurry.

587
00:59:59,529 --> 01:00:01,258
Thank you. Thank you.

588
01:00:01,831 --> 01:00:04,356
-Good luck, kid!
-Thank you, sir!

589
01:00:16,879 --> 01:00:19,473
-Bye, now.
-Bye, Edward.

590
01:00:20,883 --> 01:00:24,284
After saying my goodbyes,
I hopped three trains...

591
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:27,855
...to get to Auburn that afternoon.

592
01:01:03,026 --> 01:01:06,689
You don't know me,
but my name is Edward Bloom...

593
01:01:06,863 --> 01:01:08,262
...and I love you.

594
01:01:10,133 --> 01:01:13,864
I've spent the last three years
working to find out who you are.

595
01:01:14,037 --> 01:01:18,337
I've been shot, stabbed, and trampled
a few times. I broke my ribs twice.

596
01:01:18,808 --> 01:01:21,834
But it's all been worth it
to see you here now...

597
01:01:22,011 --> 01:01:24,980
...and to finally get to talk to you.

598
01:01:25,148 --> 01:01:27,514
Because I'm destined to marry you.

599
01:01:28,384 --> 01:01:33,720
I knew it when I saw you at the circus,
and I know it now more than ever.

600
01:01:35,892 --> 01:01:39,293
-I'm sorry.
-You don't have to apologize to me.

601
01:01:39,462 --> 01:01:41,794
I'm the luckiest person
you'll find today.

602
01:01:41,964 --> 01:01:45,092
No, I'm sorry I'm engaged
to be married.

603
01:01:52,275 --> 01:01:55,438
But you're wrong. I do know you.

604
01:01:55,611 --> 01:01:57,579
At least by reputation.

605
01:01:58,514 --> 01:02:00,914
Edward Bloom from Ashton.

606
01:02:01,451 --> 01:02:05,820
See, I'm actually engaged
to a boy from Ashton. Don Price.

607
01:02:06,522 --> 01:02:09,047
He was a few years older than you.

608
01:02:19,702 --> 01:02:21,567
Well....

609
01:02:23,706 --> 01:02:25,230
Congratulations.

610
01:02:28,478 --> 01:02:31,003
I'm sorry to have bothered you.

611
01:02:35,952 --> 01:02:39,046
Stop it! It's not funny.

612
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:42,224
That poor boy.

613
01:02:42,825 --> 01:02:46,022
Fate has a cruel way
of circling around on you.

614
01:02:46,195 --> 01:02:48,254
After all this work to leave Ashton...

615
01:02:48,431 --> 01:02:53,892
...the girl I love was now engaged
to one of its biggest jerks.

616
01:02:54,070 --> 01:02:56,300
There's a time when a man
needs to fight...

617
01:02:56,472 --> 01:02:59,930
...and a time when he needs to accept
that his destiny's lost...

618
01:03:00,109 --> 01:03:04,205
... the ship has sailed,
and that only a fool will continue.

619
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:07,679
Truth is, I've always been a fool.

620
01:03:08,718 --> 01:03:13,655
Sandra T empleton, I love you,
and I will marry you!

621
01:03:18,161 --> 01:03:21,358
So as you can see, if we apply
these rules to our everyday life...

622
01:03:22,031 --> 01:03:24,795
...supply and demand
makes much more sense.

623
01:03:24,967 --> 01:03:28,994
Take a look at the next graph, and the
import of this will be even stronger--

624
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:40,742
--for three hours.

625
01:03:40,917 --> 01:03:42,782
Look!

626
01:04:13,316 --> 01:04:16,581
-Daffodils!
-They're your favorite flower.

627
01:04:16,752 --> 01:04:18,185
How did you get so many?

628
01:04:18,888 --> 01:04:21,049
I called everywhere in five states.

629
01:04:21,224 --> 01:04:24,193
I told them it was the only way
to get my wife to marry me.

630
01:04:26,395 --> 01:04:28,090
You don't even know me.

631
01:04:28,731 --> 01:04:31,199
I have the rest of my life to find out.

632
01:04:32,335 --> 01:04:33,996
Sandra!

633
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:38,432
It's Don. Promise you won't hurt him.

634
01:04:38,608 --> 01:04:41,543
If that's what you want, I swear to it.

635
01:04:41,978 --> 01:04:44,412
-Bloom?
-Don.

636
01:04:45,214 --> 01:04:49,548
What the hell are you doing?
This is my girl. Mine!

637
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:52,313
I wasn't aware
that she belonged to anyone.

638
01:04:55,591 --> 01:04:58,583
What's the matter?
Are you too scared to fight back?

639
01:04:58,761 --> 01:05:00,422
I promised I wouldn't.

640
01:05:01,631 --> 01:05:03,929
Stop it!

641
01:05:04,433 --> 01:05:05,730
Don, stop!

642
01:05:05,902 --> 01:05:11,306
While I took the beating of a lifetime,
Don Price was ultimately defeated.

643
01:05:11,474 --> 01:05:16,241
All the physical activity had worsened
a congenital valve defect.

644
01:05:16,412 --> 01:05:18,573
Put simply, his heart
wasn't strong enough.

645
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:33,628
Don! I will never marry you.

646
01:05:34,530 --> 01:05:37,226
What?
You mean, you love this guy?

647
01:05:37,433 --> 01:05:40,561
He's almost a stranger,
and I prefer him to you.

648
01:06:08,764 --> 01:06:14,134
As it turned out, Sandra was able to
keep her same date at the chapel.

649
01:06:14,303 --> 01:06:17,500
Only the groom had changed.

650
01:06:18,474 --> 01:06:22,501
I thought you said you didn't
have a church wedding.

651
01:06:22,678 --> 01:06:25,772
We were all set to,
but there was a complication.

652
01:06:29,618 --> 01:06:33,349
Is it the medicine
that's making you thirsty?

653
01:06:33,956 --> 01:06:37,483
Truth is,
I've been thirsty my whole life.

654
01:06:38,627 --> 01:06:41,152
Never really known why.

655
01:06:41,964 --> 01:06:44,592
There was a time when I was 1 1....

656
01:06:44,767 --> 01:06:46,701
You were talking about your wedding.

657
01:06:46,869 --> 01:06:50,805
I didn't forget.
I was just working on a tangent.

658
01:06:50,973 --> 01:06:54,636
You see, most men, they'll tell you
a story straight through.

659
01:06:54,810 --> 01:06:58,541
It won't be complicated,
but it won't be interesting, either.

660
01:06:59,181 --> 01:06:59,682
I like your stories.

661
01:06:59,682 --> 01:07:00,182
I like your stories.

662
01:07:00,182 --> 01:07:00,683
I like your stories.

663
01:07:00,683 --> 01:07:01,183
And I like you.

664
01:07:01,183 --> 01:07:02,685
And I like you.

665
01:07:02,685 --> 01:07:03,519
Well, when you work for the circus,
you don't have a regular address.

666
01:07:03,519 --> 01:07:07,114
Well, when you work for the circus,
you don't have a regular address.

667
01:07:07,289 --> 01:07:10,452
So after three years,
there was a lot of undelivered mail.

668
01:07:11,394 --> 01:07:14,090
During the four weeks
I was in the hospital...

669
01:07:14,263 --> 01:07:16,925
...the postmaster
finally caught up with me.

670
01:07:17,099 --> 01:07:20,626
And it seems that while my heart
belonged to Sandra...

671
01:07:20,803 --> 01:07:26,435
...the rest of my body belonged
to the U.S. government.

672
01:07:43,426 --> 01:07:47,089
A hitch in the Army was up to
three years at that point...

673
01:07:47,263 --> 01:07:50,289
...and having waited three years
just to meet Sandra...

674
01:07:50,466 --> 01:07:54,425
...I knew I couldn't survive
being away from her that long.

675
01:07:54,603 --> 01:07:57,731
So I took every hazardous
assignment I could find...

676
01:07:57,907 --> 01:08:02,241
...with the hope of getting
my time down to less than a year.

677
01:08:02,411 --> 01:08:04,936
Go! Go!

678
01:08:07,516 --> 01:08:09,575
When I was offered
a secret mission...

679
01:08:09,752 --> 01:08:13,711
...to steal the plans for
the Wong Kai Tang power plant...

680
01:08:13,889 --> 01:08:17,017
...I jumped at the chance
to serve my country.

681
01:08:20,096 --> 01:08:22,656
Go! Go!

682
01:10:18,013 --> 01:10:20,481
Any of you got needs?

683
01:12:06,422 --> 01:12:08,447
How could you miss your cue?

684
01:12:08,624 --> 01:12:12,583
You make me look like a fool
out there alone.

685
01:12:12,928 --> 01:12:14,452
You weren't alone!

686
01:12:16,632 --> 01:12:17,826
Who the hell are you?

687
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,831
I'm not going to hurt you.

688
01:12:20,002 --> 01:12:20,991
Damn right you're not.

689
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:22,159
GUARD!

690
01:12:24,006 --> 01:12:25,667
Tell your men not to bother us!

691
01:12:25,841 --> 01:12:27,138
And close that curtain!

692
01:12:29,878 --> 01:12:32,005
Please, I need your help.

693
01:12:32,648 --> 01:12:35,139
What makes you think we'll help you?

694
01:12:43,759 --> 01:12:48,856
Over the next hour, I described
my love for Sandra K. Templeton...

695
01:12:49,031 --> 01:12:51,932
...and the ordeal that brought me
before them.

696
01:12:52,101 --> 01:12:55,468
As it had always been,
this love was my salvation.

697
01:12:55,637 --> 01:12:57,798
It was destined to be.

698
01:12:57,973 --> 01:13:01,136
We put together an elaborate
plan for escape...

699
01:13:01,310 --> 01:13:03,540
...involving a whaling ship
to Russia...

700
01:13:03,712 --> 01:13:07,773
...a barge to Cuba,
and a small, dirty canoe to Miami.

701
01:13:07,950 --> 01:13:10,441
We all knew it would be dangerous.

702
01:13:11,687 --> 01:13:14,155
And what are we supposed to do
when we get to America?

703
01:13:14,923 --> 01:13:16,220
I can get you bookings.

704
01:13:16,392 --> 01:13:19,156
I know the biggest man
in show business.

705
01:13:20,262 --> 01:13:21,286
Bob Hope?!

706
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:22,652
Bigger.

707
01:13:26,435 --> 01:13:27,424
Ready?

708
01:13:30,839 --> 01:13:34,707
And so the twins and I
began our arduous journey...

709
01:13:34,877 --> 01:13:36,811
...halfway around the world.

710
01:13:36,979 --> 01:13:41,348
Unfortunately, there was no way
to send a message back to America.

711
01:13:41,517 --> 01:13:45,510
And so it was no surprise
that the Army believed I was dead.

712
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:04,295
No, God!

713
01:14:05,941 --> 01:14:10,310
After four months, Sandra had gotten
over the worst of the nightmares.

714
01:14:10,479 --> 01:14:14,916
When the phone rang, she didn't think
it was somehow me calling her.

715
01:14:15,083 --> 01:14:19,918
When a car drove past, she didn't
get up to check out the window.

716
01:14:54,990 --> 01:14:58,084
I talked with your father last night.

717
01:15:01,563 --> 01:15:04,555
You never told me
how your parents met.

718
01:15:04,733 --> 01:15:06,564
They met at Auburn.

719
01:15:06,735 --> 01:15:10,603
What about the details?
How they fell in love.

720
01:15:10,772 --> 01:15:12,706
The circus. The war.

721
01:15:12,875 --> 01:15:14,775
You never told me any of that.

722
01:15:14,943 --> 01:15:17,104
That's because most of it
never happened.

723
01:15:18,947 --> 01:15:21,177
But it's romantic.

724
01:15:24,586 --> 01:15:27,146
-What?
-What, I know better...

725
01:15:27,322 --> 01:15:30,485
...than to argue romance
with a French woman.

726
01:15:32,227 --> 01:15:34,218
Do you love your father?

727
01:15:34,396 --> 01:15:37,991
Everyone loves my father.
He's a very likable guy.

728
01:15:39,368 --> 01:15:40,926
Do you love him?

729
01:15:46,074 --> 01:15:48,065
You have to understand.

730
01:15:48,243 --> 01:15:52,009
When I was growing up,
he was gone more than he was there.

731
01:15:52,180 --> 01:15:56,139
And I started thinking maybe he's got
this second life somewhere else.

732
01:15:57,052 --> 01:15:59,782
Another family, another house.

733
01:15:59,955 --> 01:16:03,254
And he leaves us
and goes to them.

734
01:16:03,425 --> 01:16:05,052
Or, or....

735
01:16:07,462 --> 01:16:11,558
Or maybe there is no second family.
Maybe he never wanted a family.

736
01:16:12,601 --> 01:16:17,197
Whatever it is, he likes his second life
better and he tells his stories...

737
01:16:17,372 --> 01:16:19,863
...because he can't stand
this boring place.

738
01:16:20,042 --> 01:16:23,136
-But it's not true.
-Well, what's true?

739
01:16:25,213 --> 01:16:28,011
He's never told me
a single true thing.

740
01:16:29,952 --> 01:16:31,476
Look, hey....

741
01:16:32,888 --> 01:16:35,686
I know why you like him.

742
01:16:35,857 --> 01:16:38,621
I know why everyone likes him.

743
01:16:39,761 --> 01:16:43,060
But I need you to tell me
that I'm not crazy.

744
01:16:43,231 --> 01:16:46,132
Oh, you're not.

745
01:16:48,136 --> 01:16:50,832
And I think you should talk to him.

746
01:16:56,044 --> 01:16:59,207
Larry Puckett's Chevrolet
lets the customer do the talking.

747
01:16:59,381 --> 01:17:03,044
Larry Puckett's GM-certified vehicles
are under factory warranty.

748
01:17:03,218 --> 01:17:07,245
And you can save up to 40 percent
off the original MSRP.

749
01:17:07,422 --> 01:17:10,118
-Did I ever tell you about--?
-Yes.

750
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:14,796
The maple tree and the Buick?
We've heard it.

751
01:17:17,232 --> 01:17:20,724
I know someone who hasn't.

752
01:17:20,902 --> 01:17:24,531
-The--
-Tree fell on the car, spilling the syrup.

753
01:17:24,706 --> 01:17:28,233
Which attracted the flies,
which got stuck to it...

754
01:17:28,410 --> 01:17:31,470
...and flew off with the whole car.

755
01:17:35,984 --> 01:17:39,442
But the real story
is how I got the car.

756
01:17:39,621 --> 01:17:41,316
-You see--
-Dad?

757
01:17:41,490 --> 01:17:42,957
Son.

758
01:17:43,125 --> 01:17:45,150
Can we talk?

759
01:17:47,596 --> 01:17:50,030
I think I'll get started
on these dishes.

760
01:17:50,198 --> 01:17:52,393
I'll help you.

761
01:18:07,949 --> 01:18:11,282
-You know about icebergs, Dad?
-Do l?

762
01:18:11,453 --> 01:18:13,887
I saw an iceberg once.

763
01:18:14,056 --> 01:18:17,355
They were hauling it down to Texas
for drinking water.

764
01:18:17,526 --> 01:18:21,587
They didn't count on there being
an elephant frozen inside.

765
01:18:21,763 --> 01:18:24,561
-The woolly kind. A mammoth.
-Dad!

766
01:18:24,733 --> 01:18:26,701
What?

767
01:18:28,503 --> 01:18:30,698
I'm trying to make a metaphor here.

768
01:18:30,872 --> 01:18:33,568
Well, you shouldn't have started
with a question...

769
01:18:33,742 --> 01:18:36,040
...because people
want to answer questions.

770
01:18:36,211 --> 01:18:39,806
You should've started with,
"The thing about icebergs is...."

771
01:18:39,981 --> 01:18:43,417
Okay, okay. The thing about
icebergs is you only see 1 0 percent.

772
01:18:43,585 --> 01:18:46,986
The other 90 percent is below
the water where you can't see it.

773
01:18:47,155 --> 01:18:49,214
And that's...

774
01:18:49,391 --> 01:18:52,155
...what it is with you, Dad.

775
01:18:52,327 --> 01:18:55,057
I am only seeing this little bit...

776
01:18:55,230 --> 01:18:57,061
...that sticks above the water.

777
01:18:57,232 --> 01:19:00,395
Oh, you're only seeing down
to my nose? My chin? My--

778
01:19:00,569 --> 01:19:03,504
Dad, I have no idea who you are...

779
01:19:03,672 --> 01:19:06,903
...because you've never told me
a single fact.

780
01:19:07,075 --> 01:19:11,341
I've told you a thousand facts, Will.
That's what I do, I tell stories!

781
01:19:11,513 --> 01:19:14,744
You tell...Iies, Dad.

782
01:19:14,916 --> 01:19:16,247
You tell amusing lies.

783
01:19:16,418 --> 01:19:19,512
Stories are what you tell
a 5-year-old at bedtime.

784
01:19:19,688 --> 01:19:22,555
They're not elaborate mythologies
that you maintain...

785
01:19:22,724 --> 01:19:25,158
...when your son is 1 0 and 1 5
and 20 and 30.

786
01:19:25,327 --> 01:19:28,194
And I believed you.

787
01:19:29,965 --> 01:19:33,401
I believed your stories
so much longer than I should have.

788
01:19:33,568 --> 01:19:36,662
Then when I realized
everything you said was impossible...

789
01:19:36,838 --> 01:19:39,068
...I felt like a fool
to have trusted you.

790
01:19:39,241 --> 01:19:41,505
You're like Santa Claus
and the Easter Bunny.

791
01:19:41,676 --> 01:19:43,507
Just as charming and just as fake.

792
01:19:43,678 --> 01:19:45,908
You think I'm fake.

793
01:19:47,382 --> 01:19:51,512
Only on the surface, Dad.
But it's all I've ever seen.

794
01:19:53,288 --> 01:19:54,949
Look.

795
01:19:56,525 --> 01:19:58,959
I'm about to have...

796
01:19:59,461 --> 01:20:00,689
...a kid of my own.

797
01:20:00,862 --> 01:20:03,558
It would kill me
if he went through his whole life...

798
01:20:03,732 --> 01:20:05,791
...never understanding me.

799
01:20:05,967 --> 01:20:08,401
It would kill you, huh?

800
01:20:10,372 --> 01:20:13,899
What do you want, Will?
Who do you want me to be?

801
01:20:14,075 --> 01:20:15,736
Just yourself.

802
01:20:15,911 --> 01:20:19,711
Good, bad, everything.
Just show me who you are for once.

803
01:20:19,881 --> 01:20:22,975
I've been nothing but myself
since the day I was born.

804
01:20:23,151 --> 01:20:27,679
And if you can't see that,
it's your failing, not mine!

805
01:20:59,020 --> 01:21:03,582
Your father decided
that he needed to have an office...

806
01:21:03,758 --> 01:21:06,852
...and, of course, it wouldn't do
to have it in the house.

807
01:21:07,028 --> 01:21:08,552
So....

808
01:21:10,198 --> 01:21:13,929
You'll know better than me
what's important.

809
01:21:25,247 --> 01:21:27,374
What is it?

810
01:21:28,817 --> 01:21:30,808
It was during the war.

811
01:21:30,986 --> 01:21:34,854
Your father went missing.
They thought he was dead.

812
01:21:36,057 --> 01:21:38,457
Oh, that really happened?

813
01:21:38,627 --> 01:21:42,393
Not everything your father says
is a complete fabrication.

814
01:21:43,732 --> 01:21:46,758
I think I'll go check on him.

815
01:21:48,937 --> 01:21:51,599
I need to lie down for a bit.

816
01:21:51,773 --> 01:21:54,401
Okay, go.

817
01:22:09,190 --> 01:22:13,957
After the war, the sons of Alabama
returned home, looking for work.

818
01:22:14,129 --> 01:22:15,892
Each had the advantage over me.

819
01:22:16,064 --> 01:22:19,625
They were alive,
while I was officially deceased.

820
01:22:19,801 --> 01:22:21,564
With my prospects few...

821
01:22:21,736 --> 01:22:25,536
...I took a job as a traveling salesman.
It suited me.

822
01:22:25,707 --> 01:22:28,835
If there was one thing
you can say about Edward Bloom...

823
01:22:29,010 --> 01:22:31,240
...it's that I am a social person.

824
01:22:31,947 --> 01:22:35,348
-Congratulations.
-Thank you, sir.

825
01:22:36,017 --> 01:22:38,611
I could be gone
for weeks at a time.

826
01:22:38,787 --> 01:22:41,722
But every other Friday,
I put all the money I made...

827
01:22:41,890 --> 01:22:45,519
...into an account set aside
for a proper house...

828
01:22:45,694 --> 01:22:47,889
...with a white picket fence.

829
01:22:53,668 --> 01:22:57,195
I'd like a moment of your time
to tell you about my new product...

830
01:22:57,372 --> 01:22:59,704
...the Handi-matic.

831
01:23:15,190 --> 01:23:18,489
A few years later, I added
other products and other cities...

832
01:23:18,660 --> 01:23:22,221
...until my territory stretched from
the coast to western Texas.

833
01:23:47,088 --> 01:23:48,578
Edward?

834
01:23:48,757 --> 01:23:50,384
Edward Bloom!

835
01:23:50,558 --> 01:23:52,185
It's me, Norther Winslow.

836
01:23:52,360 --> 01:23:54,225
I don't believe it.

837
01:23:54,396 --> 01:23:58,696
I was astonished to see the greatest
poet of both Ashton and Spectre...

838
01:23:58,867 --> 01:24:00,767
...all the way out in Texas.

839
01:24:00,935 --> 01:24:04,803
I want you to know, when you left
Spectre, it opened my eyes.

840
01:24:04,973 --> 01:24:08,636
There was a whole life out there
that I was not living.

841
01:24:08,810 --> 01:24:10,300
So I traveled.

842
01:24:10,478 --> 01:24:13,641
I saw France, Africa,
half of South America.

843
01:24:13,815 --> 01:24:16,443
Every day, a new adventure.
That's my motto.

844
01:24:16,618 --> 01:24:18,779
That's great, Norther.
I'm happy for you.

845
01:24:18,953 --> 01:24:21,217
What are you doing now?

846
01:24:22,323 --> 01:24:23,950
I'm robbing this place.

847
01:24:27,996 --> 01:24:29,964
All right, everybody down!

848
01:24:31,433 --> 01:24:34,698
Hey!
Just slide that over.

849
01:24:40,909 --> 01:24:43,673
-Would you mind grabbing that?
-What?

850
01:24:44,112 --> 01:24:45,602
The gun.

851
01:24:47,115 --> 01:24:49,549
I'm gonna be cleaning out
the cash drawers...

852
01:24:49,717 --> 01:24:53,915
...and my associate here
is gonna handle the vault.

853
01:24:59,928 --> 01:25:03,386
All right, you!
You help my friend, okay?

854
01:25:04,199 --> 01:25:05,860
Let's go!

855
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:27,454
I'm sorry, ma'am.
I am.

856
01:25:27,622 --> 01:25:30,750
I really just don't want anyone
to get hurt.

857
01:25:30,925 --> 01:25:32,859
It's not that.

858
01:25:33,828 --> 01:25:35,762
It's just....

859
01:25:41,236 --> 01:25:42,828
There's no money.

860
01:25:43,638 --> 01:25:47,506
We're completely bankrupt.
Don't tell anybody.

861
01:25:47,675 --> 01:25:51,668
It turned out that the Savings & Loan
had already been robbed...

862
01:25:51,846 --> 01:25:56,340
...not by armed bandits, but
by speculators in Texas real estate.

863
01:25:56,518 --> 01:25:58,509
All right, let's go!

864
01:26:09,697 --> 01:26:11,722
Norther!

865
01:26:31,352 --> 01:26:34,116
Yeah! There's gotta be
close to $400 here!

866
01:26:34,289 --> 01:26:36,780
And that's just from the drawers.

867
01:26:36,958 --> 01:26:39,426
Let's see what you got
from the vault.

868
01:26:49,337 --> 01:26:51,931
This is it? The whole vault?

869
01:26:52,106 --> 01:26:54,472
I'm afraid so.

870
01:26:57,212 --> 01:26:59,146
It's got your deposit slip on it.

871
01:26:59,314 --> 01:27:02,181
Well, I just didn't want you
leaving empty-handed.

872
01:27:02,350 --> 01:27:06,116
There's something you should know.
The reason they don't have money....

873
01:27:06,287 --> 01:27:09,552
I told Norther about
the vagaries of Texas oil money...

874
01:27:09,724 --> 01:27:12,591
...and its effect on real-estate prices...

875
01:27:12,760 --> 01:27:15,923
...and how lax enforcement
of fiduciary process...

876
01:27:16,097 --> 01:27:19,897
...had made savings and loans
particularly vulnerable.

877
01:27:20,068 --> 01:27:24,869
Hearing this news,
Norther was left with one conclusion:

878
01:27:25,039 --> 01:27:28,236
I should go to Wall Street.
That's where all the money is.

879
01:27:28,409 --> 01:27:32,004
I knew then that while my days
as a criminal were over...

880
01:27:32,180 --> 01:27:33,442
Thanks for the hand!

881
01:27:33,615 --> 01:27:35,606
...Norther's were just beginning.

882
01:27:35,783 --> 01:27:38,217
When Norther made
his first million dollars...

883
01:27:38,386 --> 01:27:40,650
...he sent me a check for 10,000.

884
01:27:40,822 --> 01:27:44,918
I protested, but he said it was my fee
as his career advisor.

885
01:27:45,093 --> 01:27:48,256
It was enough to buy my wife
a proper house...

886
01:27:48,429 --> 01:27:50,488
... with a white picket fence.

887
01:27:50,665 --> 01:27:54,863
And for that, it was all the riches
a man could ever want.

888
01:28:28,736 --> 01:28:30,670
I was drying out.

889
01:28:32,440 --> 01:28:34,340
I see.

890
01:28:36,511 --> 01:28:40,709
I think we ought to get you
a plant mister...

891
01:28:40,882 --> 01:28:43,680
...so we can just spray you
like a fern.

892
01:29:09,610 --> 01:29:12,078
Come, now.

893
01:29:16,417 --> 01:29:19,818
I don't think I'll ever dry out.

894
01:30:18,012 --> 01:30:21,038
You carry on. I'll see....

895
01:30:25,720 --> 01:30:27,517
Hello.

896
01:30:28,089 --> 01:30:32,025
-Are you Jennifer Hill?
-I am.

897
01:30:32,193 --> 01:30:34,354
And you're Will.

898
01:30:34,529 --> 01:30:37,498
I've seen a picture of you.
That's how I recognize you.

899
01:30:40,201 --> 01:30:42,863
Listen, Kenny,
why don't we skip the lesson today?

900
01:30:43,037 --> 01:30:45,335
We can go again next week.

901
01:30:45,506 --> 01:30:47,531
Do I have to give it back to my mom?

902
01:30:47,708 --> 01:30:50,268
Well, I won't tell her if you won't.

903
01:31:01,722 --> 01:31:03,189
How did you know my father?

904
01:31:03,591 --> 01:31:05,650
Well, this was on his sales route...

905
01:31:05,827 --> 01:31:09,888
...so he was through here all the time,
and everyone in town knew him.

906
01:31:10,064 --> 01:31:12,123
Were you having an affair?

907
01:31:14,535 --> 01:31:16,969
Wow. Wow, you just said it.

908
01:31:17,772 --> 01:31:21,401
I was expecting to dance
around this for another half-hour.

909
01:31:23,211 --> 01:31:26,237
I've seen him with women.
He flirts. He always has.

910
01:31:26,414 --> 01:31:30,544
And on some level,
I just presumed that he was...

911
01:31:30,718 --> 01:31:34,245
...cheating on my mom.
I just never had proof.

912
01:31:36,924 --> 01:31:38,824
Well, can I ask you a question?

913
01:31:38,993 --> 01:31:41,723
If you found this deed,
why didn't you just ask Eddie?

914
01:31:42,864 --> 01:31:45,196
Because he's dying.

915
01:31:53,908 --> 01:31:58,572
Look, I don't know how much
you want to know about any of this.

916
01:31:58,746 --> 01:32:00,873
You have one image of your father...

917
01:32:01,048 --> 01:32:03,312
...and it'd be wrong of me
to change it...

918
01:32:03,484 --> 01:32:05,418
...especially this late in the game.

919
01:32:05,686 --> 01:32:08,052
My father talked about things
he never did...

920
01:32:08,222 --> 01:32:11,589
...and I'm sure he did a lot of things
that he never talked about.

921
01:32:11,759 --> 01:32:13,784
I'm just trying to reconcile the two.

922
01:32:17,231 --> 01:32:20,325
The first thing
you have to understand...

923
01:32:20,501 --> 01:32:23,470
...is that your father
never meant to end up here.

924
01:32:24,038 --> 01:32:25,403
Yet he did.

925
01:32:25,606 --> 01:32:27,301
Twice.

926
01:32:27,842 --> 01:32:30,333
The first time, he was early.

927
01:32:30,511 --> 01:32:32,741
The second time, he was late.

928
01:32:34,849 --> 01:32:38,751
Those days, your father was working
for himself.

929
01:32:38,920 --> 01:32:41,855
If there's one thing you could
say about Edward Bloom...

930
01:32:42,023 --> 01:32:47,017
...it's that he was a social person,
and people took a liking to him.

931
01:32:47,194 --> 01:32:50,425
One night, he was returning
from three weeks on the road...

932
01:32:50,598 --> 01:32:54,295
... when he hit a thunderstorm
unlike any in his life.

933
01:34:42,610 --> 01:34:45,135
Fate has a way of circling back
on a man...

934
01:34:45,312 --> 01:34:47,405
...and taking him by surprise.

935
01:34:52,153 --> 01:34:55,816
A man sees things differently
at different times in his life.

936
01:34:55,990 --> 01:34:59,926
This town didn't seem the same
now that he was older.

937
01:35:01,128 --> 01:35:04,655
A new road had brought
the outside world to Spectre...

938
01:35:04,832 --> 01:35:07,960
...and with it, banks, liens and debt.

939
01:35:08,135 --> 01:35:12,970
Almost everywhere you looked,
people were bankrupt.

940
01:35:14,241 --> 01:35:17,608
The auction today
is for the town of Spectre.

941
01:35:17,778 --> 01:35:20,508
-The opening bid will be $1 0,000.
-So Edward Bloom...

942
01:35:20,681 --> 01:35:23,309
-...decided to buy the town.
-50,000.

943
01:35:27,488 --> 01:35:30,685
-I couldn't believe my eyes--
-He was never a wealthy man...

944
01:35:30,858 --> 01:35:36,023
...but he had made other men rich,
and now he asked for their favors.

945
01:35:37,932 --> 01:35:40,958
-I'm trying to save....
-Most of them hadn't seen Spectre.

946
01:35:41,135 --> 01:35:44,366
They only had Edward's words
to describe it.

947
01:35:44,538 --> 01:35:47,837
That's all he needed.
He sold them on the dream.

948
01:35:48,242 --> 01:35:50,733
So first he bought the farms.

949
01:35:50,911 --> 01:35:54,813
Then he bought the houses.
And then he bought the stores.

950
01:35:55,416 --> 01:36:00,513
Whatever he bought, the people were
not asked to leave or pay rent.

951
01:36:00,688 --> 01:36:03,589
They were just asked to keep
doing as they were doing.

952
01:36:03,958 --> 01:36:07,985
In that way, he could make sure
the town would never die.

953
01:36:10,431 --> 01:36:15,698
Within six months, his trust had
purchased the entire town.

954
01:36:15,870 --> 01:36:18,532
With one exception.

955
01:36:42,763 --> 01:36:45,823
You must be Edward Bloom.

956
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:47,297
How do you know?

957
01:36:47,902 --> 01:36:50,598
No one would come out here
unless they had business.

958
01:36:50,805 --> 01:36:53,797
And no one would have business
with me except for you.

959
01:36:53,974 --> 01:36:56,340
You're buying the town.

960
01:36:56,844 --> 01:37:00,871
Apparently I overlooked this one
piece of it, and I'd like to remedy that.

961
01:37:01,482 --> 01:37:06,385
In order for the town to be preserved,
the trust must own it, in its entirety.

962
01:37:06,554 --> 01:37:07,919
And so I've heard.

963
01:37:08,088 --> 01:37:11,546
I'll offer you more than it's worth.
And you won't have to move.

964
01:37:11,725 --> 01:37:15,161
Nothing will change except the name
on the deed, you have my word.

965
01:37:15,329 --> 01:37:17,991
Now, let me get this straight.

966
01:37:18,165 --> 01:37:20,827
You buy the swamp from me,
but I'll stay in it?

967
01:37:21,001 --> 01:37:23,663
You'll own the house,
but it'll still be mine?

968
01:37:23,838 --> 01:37:27,831
I'll be here, and you'll come and go as
you please to one place or another.

969
01:37:28,008 --> 01:37:29,976
Do I have that right?

970
01:37:30,144 --> 01:37:32,738
In so many words, yes.

971
01:37:33,614 --> 01:37:35,582
Yeah, then I don't think so,
Mr. Bloom.

972
01:37:36,250 --> 01:37:39,276
If nothing's gonna change,
I'd just as soon it not change...

973
01:37:39,453 --> 01:37:42,422
...in the way things haven't been
changing all this time.

974
01:37:43,657 --> 01:37:48,424
It's not like you'll lose anything.
You can ask anyone in town.

975
01:37:49,830 --> 01:37:52,321
Why are you buying this land,
Mr. Bloom?

976
01:37:52,499 --> 01:37:54,057
Some sort of midlife crisis?

977
01:37:54,835 --> 01:37:57,599
Instead of buying a convertible,
you buy a town?

978
01:37:58,072 --> 01:38:00,233
Helping people makes me happy.

979
01:38:00,941 --> 01:38:04,104
I'm not convinced
you should be happy.

980
01:38:04,278 --> 01:38:08,237
-I'm sorry. Have I offended you?
-No.

981
01:38:08,415 --> 01:38:10,315
You did exactly what you promised.

982
01:38:10,951 --> 01:38:15,581
You came back.
I was just expecting you sooner.

983
01:38:23,130 --> 01:38:24,722
You're Beamen's daughter.

984
01:38:26,533 --> 01:38:29,263
Your name's different.
Did you get married?

985
01:38:30,004 --> 01:38:35,067
I was 1 8. He was 28.
Turns out that was a big difference.

986
01:38:44,685 --> 01:38:47,950
I won't be selling you this house,
Mr. Bloom.

987
01:38:48,856 --> 01:38:50,585
I see.

988
01:38:51,592 --> 01:38:53,992
Well, thank you for your time.

989
01:39:05,239 --> 01:39:08,367
-It's stuck.
-Yeah.

990
01:39:18,652 --> 01:39:21,712
-Oh, I'm so sorry! I--
-It's okay. Just leave it.

991
01:39:21,889 --> 01:39:24,380
-No, I'll--
-Please! Just go.

992
01:39:25,926 --> 01:39:28,486
-But--
-Go.

993
01:39:30,798 --> 01:39:35,565
Most men in that situation would
accept their failure and move on.

994
01:39:35,736 --> 01:39:37,805
But Edward was not like most men.

995
01:39:37,805 --> 01:39:38,794
But Edward was not like most men.

996
01:39:48,148 --> 01:39:49,581
Hold!

997
01:39:53,020 --> 01:39:55,853
They both had completely
different characters but...

998
01:39:56,023 --> 01:39:58,719
...well, just one pair of legs.

999
01:40:09,069 --> 01:40:12,630
As the months passed, he found
more and more things to fix...

1000
01:40:12,806 --> 01:40:16,708
...until the shack no longer
resembled itself.

1001
01:40:32,926 --> 01:40:36,953
Of course, the best part
was coming up with the new material.

1002
01:40:37,731 --> 01:40:40,199
By the time the twins and l
had got to Havana...

1003
01:40:40,367 --> 01:40:45,964
...we'd worked out a new routine,
using only a ukulele and a harmonica.

1004
01:41:05,259 --> 01:41:08,820
-Well....
-You could leave it there.

1005
01:41:26,346 --> 01:41:27,938
No.

1006
01:41:38,025 --> 01:41:39,959
Now, don't.

1007
01:41:40,127 --> 01:41:45,292
Don't be embarrassed. I should never
have let you think that....

1008
01:41:46,133 --> 01:41:48,931
I'm in love with my wife.

1009
01:41:49,937 --> 01:41:51,928
Yeah, I know.

1010
01:41:52,106 --> 01:41:55,234
And from the first day I saw her
until the day I die...

1011
01:41:55,409 --> 01:41:57,468
...she's the only one.

1012
01:41:58,212 --> 01:42:00,146
Lucky girl.

1013
01:42:01,181 --> 01:42:04,116
I'm sorry, Jenny. I am.

1014
01:42:12,025 --> 01:42:14,323
Wait! Edward.

1015
01:42:55,903 --> 01:42:58,804
One day, Edward Bloom left...

1016
01:42:58,972 --> 01:43:02,806
...and never returned
to the town he'd saved.

1017
01:43:15,355 --> 01:43:17,186
As for the girl...

1018
01:43:17,357 --> 01:43:20,053
...the common belief
was that she'd become a witch...

1019
01:43:20,227 --> 01:43:22,627
...and crazy at that.

1020
01:43:24,064 --> 01:43:27,522
She became something
of a legend herself.

1021
01:43:28,802 --> 01:43:33,205
And the story ended where it began.

1022
01:43:34,341 --> 01:43:37,242
Logically, you couldn't be
the witch, because she was...

1023
01:43:37,411 --> 01:43:38,708
...old when he was young.

1024
01:43:39,012 --> 01:43:42,140
Well, it's logical if you think
like your father.

1025
01:43:43,116 --> 01:43:46,984
See, to him there's only
two women:

1026
01:43:47,154 --> 01:43:48,746
Your mother...

1027
01:43:48,922 --> 01:43:50,287
...and everyone else.

1028
01:43:50,557 --> 01:43:52,457
And one day...

1029
01:43:52,626 --> 01:43:57,086
...I realized I was in love with a man
who could never love me back.

1030
01:43:58,131 --> 01:44:00,292
I was living in a fairy tale.

1031
01:44:01,435 --> 01:44:03,767
I'm not sure I should've told you
any of this.

1032
01:44:03,937 --> 01:44:06,462
No, no, no, I wanted to know. I'm....

1033
01:44:06,640 --> 01:44:08,107
I'm glad I know.

1034
01:44:08,809 --> 01:44:12,142
I wanted to be as important to him
as you were.

1035
01:44:12,646 --> 01:44:14,443
And I'm....

1036
01:44:14,915 --> 01:44:16,314
I was never gonna be.

1037
01:44:19,286 --> 01:44:21,447
I was make-believe.

1038
01:44:22,923 --> 01:44:27,292
And his other life, you....

1039
01:44:28,128 --> 01:44:29,686
You were real.

1040
01:44:53,987 --> 01:44:55,579
Mom?

1041
01:44:56,623 --> 01:44:58,454
Josephine?

1042
01:45:00,294 --> 01:45:02,159
Josephine?

1043
01:45:15,809 --> 01:45:17,868
Will!

1044
01:45:19,012 --> 01:45:20,240
What happened?

1045
01:45:20,414 --> 01:45:22,177
Your father had a stroke.

1046
01:45:22,349 --> 01:45:25,477
He's upstairs with your mom
and Dr. Bennett.

1047
01:45:25,652 --> 01:45:26,983
Is he gonna be okay?

1048
01:45:34,928 --> 01:45:37,021
I don't suppose that I could...

1049
01:45:37,197 --> 01:45:39,688
...stay here with him.
I mean, in case....

1050
01:45:40,534 --> 01:45:43,469
In case he wakes up,
I really ought to be here.

1051
01:45:43,637 --> 01:45:44,899
I'll stay.

1052
01:45:45,939 --> 01:45:48,965
Why don't you go home with
Josephine. I'll stay tonight.

1053
01:45:50,811 --> 01:45:53,780
-ls that okay?
-Fine.

1054
01:45:56,683 --> 01:45:59,584
Will, you'll call if there's any...?

1055
01:45:59,753 --> 01:46:02,881
I will. I will. I'll call.

1056
01:46:04,458 --> 01:46:08,451
-Do you want some time with Dad?
-Yes. Thank you.

1057
01:47:12,559 --> 01:47:16,086
Glad to see you're not trying
to have a heartfelt talk.

1058
01:47:19,266 --> 01:47:21,860
One of my greatest
annoyances is when...

1059
01:47:22,035 --> 01:47:24,970
...people try to talk to those
who can't hear them.

1060
01:47:25,138 --> 01:47:27,265
Well, we have an advantage.

1061
01:47:27,441 --> 01:47:29,875
My father and I never talk.

1062
01:47:36,416 --> 01:47:39,476
Your father ever tell you
about the day you were born?

1063
01:47:39,653 --> 01:47:43,089
Yeah, a thousand times.
He caught an uncatchable fish.

1064
01:47:43,256 --> 01:47:47,215
Not that. The real story.
He ever tell you that?

1065
01:47:47,394 --> 01:47:49,225
No.

1066
01:47:49,396 --> 01:47:52,854
Well, your mother came in about
3 in the afternoon.

1067
01:47:53,033 --> 01:47:57,493
Her neighbor drove her, on account of
your father was away on business...

1068
01:47:57,671 --> 01:47:59,332
...in Wichita.

1069
01:47:59,506 --> 01:48:03,840
You were born a week early,
but there were no complications.

1070
01:48:04,010 --> 01:48:09,676
It was a perfect delivery.
Your father was sorry not to be there.

1071
01:48:10,217 --> 01:48:14,950
But it wasn't the custom then for men
to be in the room for deliveries...

1072
01:48:15,121 --> 01:48:19,387
...so I can't see how it would've been
much different had he been there.

1073
01:48:19,559 --> 01:48:22,323
And that's the real story
of how you were born.

1074
01:48:22,963 --> 01:48:25,397
Not very exciting, is it?

1075
01:48:25,565 --> 01:48:29,433
And I suppose if I had to choose
between the true version...

1076
01:48:29,603 --> 01:48:34,131
...and an elaborate one involving
a fish and a wedding ring...

1077
01:48:34,307 --> 01:48:36,275
...I might choose the fancy version.

1078
01:48:36,977 --> 01:48:38,945
But, then that's just me.

1079
01:48:40,013 --> 01:48:41,537
I kind of liked your version.

1080
01:49:04,104 --> 01:49:05,696
Dad?

1081
01:49:07,841 --> 01:49:11,402
Hey, Dad? Hey, you want me
to get the nurse?

1082
01:49:13,280 --> 01:49:16,340
What do you want? What can I do?
What can I get?

1083
01:49:16,516 --> 01:49:18,575
You want some water?

1084
01:49:19,653 --> 01:49:21,143
You want a bit of water?

1085
01:49:24,057 --> 01:49:26,753
The river.

1086
01:49:28,295 --> 01:49:30,160
The river?

1087
01:49:30,630 --> 01:49:34,828
Tell me how it happens.

1088
01:49:36,703 --> 01:49:38,637
How what happens?

1089
01:49:39,673 --> 01:49:42,107
How I go.

1090
01:49:46,479 --> 01:49:48,947
You mean what you saw in The Eye?

1091
01:50:02,963 --> 01:50:06,296
I don't know that story, Dad.
You never told me that one.

1092
01:50:09,169 --> 01:50:12,229
Okay. Hey, okay, I'll try.

1093
01:50:12,405 --> 01:50:15,033
I need your help.
Tell me how it starts.

1094
01:50:17,277 --> 01:50:20,940
Like this.

1095
01:50:21,114 --> 01:50:23,139
Okay. Okay.

1096
01:50:25,785 --> 01:50:29,243
Okay, so it's in the morning...

1097
01:50:29,422 --> 01:50:33,518
...and you and I are in the hospital,
and I've fallen asleep. And I wake up...

1098
01:50:33,994 --> 01:50:37,395
...and I see you,
and somehow you're better.

1099
01:50:37,564 --> 01:50:38,656
Dad?

1100
01:50:38,832 --> 01:50:40,857
You're different.

1101
01:50:41,768 --> 01:50:44,760
-Dad.
-Let's get out of here.

1102
01:50:44,938 --> 01:50:46,200
Then I say:

1103
01:50:46,373 --> 01:50:47,806
Dad, you're in no condition--

1104
01:50:47,974 --> 01:50:50,374
Get that wheelchair.

1105
01:50:52,812 --> 01:50:54,712
Hurry up! We haven't much time!

1106
01:50:54,881 --> 01:50:57,349
Once we get off this floor,
we're in the clear.

1107
01:50:57,517 --> 01:50:59,212
And we get in the wheelchair...

1108
01:50:59,386 --> 01:51:02,753
-Faster!
-...Iike we're escaping the hospital.

1109
01:51:02,922 --> 01:51:04,719
What are you doing?

1110
01:51:04,924 --> 01:51:07,256
We pass Dr. Bennett,
who tries to slow us down.

1111
01:51:07,427 --> 01:51:10,396
-Stop them!
-We're flying down the hall.

1112
01:51:10,563 --> 01:51:12,497
Orderly after orderly is chasing us.

1113
01:51:12,666 --> 01:51:14,725
Mom and Josephine
are at the end.

1114
01:51:14,901 --> 01:51:17,665
No time to explain! Stall them!

1115
01:51:23,343 --> 01:51:25,368
We come flying out
over the curb...

1116
01:51:25,545 --> 01:51:29,914
...and your old red Charger is there.
But it's new. Brand-new.

1117
01:51:30,083 --> 01:51:32,415
And I pick you up...

1118
01:51:32,585 --> 01:51:36,214
...and somehow you hardly weigh
anything. I can't explain it.

1119
01:51:40,493 --> 01:51:43,223
Leave it! We don't need it!

1120
01:51:45,298 --> 01:51:47,630
Water. I need water.

1121
01:51:50,937 --> 01:51:52,962
-Where are we going?
-The river.

1122
01:51:59,946 --> 01:52:02,437
And we have to take Glenville
to avoid traffic...

1123
01:52:02,615 --> 01:52:05,379
...because the damn church
people drive too slow.

1124
01:52:46,159 --> 01:52:51,426
And as we get close to the river...

1125
01:53:00,073 --> 01:53:02,268
He's here!

1126
01:53:02,575 --> 01:53:05,442
...we see that everybody
is already there.

1127
01:53:21,861 --> 01:53:23,453
And I mean...

1128
01:53:24,731 --> 01:53:25,993
...everyone.

1129
01:53:38,511 --> 01:53:41,207
It's unbelievable.

1130
01:53:41,748 --> 01:53:45,878
The story of my life.

1131
01:53:54,460 --> 01:53:57,395
The strange thing is, there's
not a sad face to be found.

1132
01:53:57,564 --> 01:54:00,124
Everyone is just so glad
to see you...

1133
01:54:01,234 --> 01:54:03,532
...and send you off right.

1134
01:54:03,703 --> 01:54:09,335
Goodbye, everybody!
Farewell! Adieu!

1135
01:54:20,687 --> 01:54:23,281
My girl in the river.

1136
01:55:34,827 --> 01:55:37,660
You become what you always were.

1137
01:55:39,299 --> 01:55:41,665
A very big fish.

1138
01:55:46,773 --> 01:55:49,105
And that's how it happens.

1139
01:55:50,677 --> 01:55:52,474
Yeah.

1140
01:55:54,948 --> 01:55:57,508
Exactly.

1141
01:56:39,592 --> 01:56:40,991
Mom?

1142
01:58:08,214 --> 01:58:11,445
The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not be in want.

1143
01:58:11,617 --> 01:58:15,144
He makes me to lie down
in green pastures.

1144
01:58:15,321 --> 01:58:18,290
He leads me beside the quiet waters.

1145
01:58:18,458 --> 01:58:20,426
He restores my soul.

1146
01:58:20,593 --> 01:58:24,586
He guides me in the paths of
righteousness for his name's sake.

1147
01:58:25,231 --> 01:58:28,462
Yea, though I walk through
the valley of the shadow of death...

1148
01:58:28,634 --> 01:58:31,262
...I will fear no evil,
for you are with me.

1149
01:58:31,437 --> 01:58:35,771
Surely goodness and love will
follow me all the days of my life.

1150
01:59:22,755 --> 01:59:27,192
Have you ever heard a joke so many
times you've forgotten why it's funny?

1151
01:59:27,360 --> 01:59:31,456
And then you hear it again
and suddenly it's new.

1152
01:59:31,631 --> 01:59:34,794
You remember why you loved it
in the first place.

1153
01:59:36,636 --> 01:59:39,833
So he said he'll fight the giant
who was 1 5 feet tall!

1154
01:59:40,006 --> 01:59:43,442
-No way!
-Dad! That's right, isn't it?

1155
01:59:43,609 --> 01:59:44,940
Pretty much.

1156
01:59:45,111 --> 01:59:47,341
See? So he was a giant.

1157
01:59:47,513 --> 01:59:49,981
That was my father's final joke,
I guess.

1158
01:59:50,149 --> 01:59:56,088
A man tells his stories so many times
that he becomes the stories.

1159
01:59:57,523 --> 01:59:59,855
They live on after him.

1160
02:00:02,128 --> 02:00:05,495
And in that way,
he becomes immortal.

1161
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:09,084
