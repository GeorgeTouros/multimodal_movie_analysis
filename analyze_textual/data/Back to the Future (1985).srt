00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,200
<i>October is inventory time.</i>

3
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:31,640
<i>So right now, Statler Toyota is making
the best deals of the year...</i>

4
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,800
<i>on all 1985-model Toyotas.</i>

5
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,560
<i>You won't find a better car...</i>

6
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:39,200
<i>at a better price with better service
anywhere in Hill Valley.</i>

7
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,440
<i>The Senate is expected
to vote on this today.</i>

8
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,560
<i>In other news, officials at
the Pacific Nuclear research facility...</i>

9
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,640
<i>have denied the rumor
that a case of missing plutonium...</i>

10
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,440
<i>was in fact stolen
from their vault two weeks ago.</i>

11
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,160
<i>A Libyan terrorist group had claimed
responsibility for the alleged theft.</i>

12
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:06,000
<i>However, officials now attribute the
discrepancy to a simple clerical error.</i>

13
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:09,630
<i>The FBI, which is investigating
the matter, had no comment.</i>

14
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,000
Doc ?

15
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,760
Hello ! Anybody home ?

16
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,160
Einstein, come here, boy.

17
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,240
What's going on ? God.

18
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,960
Jesus !

19
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,320
That is disgusting.

20
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,950
Rock 'n' roll.

21
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:40,560
- Yo.
<i>- Marty, is that you ?</i>

22
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:42,600
Doc. Where are you ?

23
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,920
<i>Thank God I've found you. Meet me
at Twin Pines Mall tonight at 1:15.</i>

24
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,440
<i>I made a major breakthrough.
I'll need your assistance.</i>

25
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,600
1:15 in the morning ?
Doc, what's going on ?

26
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:53,680
- Where you been all week ?
<i>- Working.</i>

27
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:56,680
- Is Einstein with you ?
<i>- Yeah, he's right here.</i>

28
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,160
You left your equipment on all week.

29
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,720
<i>My equipment. That reminds me, Marty.</i>

30
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:05,520
<i>Do not hook up to the amplifier.
There's a slight possibility of overload.</i>

31
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,880
Yeah. I'll keep that in mind.

32
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,200
<i>Good. I'll see you tonight.
Don't forget.</i>

33
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:13,080
<i>- 1:15 a.m., Twin Pines Mall.</i>
- Right.

34
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,830
<i>- Are those my clocks I hear ?</i>
- Yeah, it's 8:00.

35
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,440
<i>Perfect ! My experiment worked !</i>

36
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,480
<i>They're all exactly 25 minutes slow !</i>

37
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,280
Wait a minute, Doc.

38
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,520
Are you telling me that it's 8:25 ?

39
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,800
<i>- Precisely.</i>
- Damn !

40
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,520
I'm late for school.

41
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,200
- Jennifer.
- Strickland's looking for you.

42
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,840
If you get caught,
it'll be four tardies in a row.

43
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,640
All right, come on. I think we're safe.

44
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:50,040
This time it wasn't my fault. The doc
set all his clocks 25 minutes slow.

45
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,440
The doc ?

46
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,440
Am I to understand you're still hanging
around with Dr. Emmett Brown, McFly ?

47
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,280
Tardy slip for you, Miss Parker.

48
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,880
And one for you, McFly.
I believe that's four in a row.

49
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,240
Let me give you a nickel's worth
of free advice, young man.

50
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,360
This so-called Dr. Brown is dangerous.
He's a real nutcase.

51
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,000
Hang around with him,
you'll end up in big trouble.

52
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,640
Yes, sir.

53
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,800
You got a real attitude problem.
You're a slacker.

54
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,200
You remind me of your father
when he went here. He was a slacker, too.

55
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,520
Can I go now, Mr. Strickland ?

56
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,040
Your band is on the roster for
the dance auditions after school today.

57
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,440
Why even bother ?
You don't have a chance.

58
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,440
You're too much like your old man.

59
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:34,240
No McFly ever amounted to anything
in the history of Hill Valley.

60
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,280
Yeah, well, history is going to change.

61
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,760
<i>Next, please.</i>

62
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,160
<i>All right.</i>

63
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,600
<i>We're the Pinheads.</i>

64
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,360
<i>One, two, three.</i>

65
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:20,040
<i>Okay, that's enough.
Thank you, fellas.</i>

66
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,200
<i>Hold it, fellas.</i>

67
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,840
<i>I'm afraid you're just too darn loud.</i>

68
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,080
<i>Next, please.</i>

69
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,000
<i>Next group, please.</i>

70
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:36,040
<i>Re-elect Mayor Goldie Wilson.</i>

71
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,120
<i>Progress is his middle name.</i>

72
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,000
"Too loud." I can't believe it.

73
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,720
We'll never get a chance
to play in front of anybody.

74
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:45,160
Marty, one rejection
isn't the end of the world.

75
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,480
I just don't think
I'm cut out for music.

76
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:51,000
But you're really good,
and your audition tape is great.

77
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,320
You've got to send it in
to the record company.

78
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,160
- It's like Doc's always saying.
- I know.

79
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,280
If you put your mind to it,
you can accomplish anything.

80
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:00,480
That's good advice.

81
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,040
All right. What if I send in the tape
and they don't like it ?

82
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,040
What if they say I'm no good ?

83
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,120
What if they say, "You got no future" ?

84
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,440
I can't take that kind of rejection.

85
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:13,440
I'm starting to sound like my old man.

86
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,440
- He's not that bad.
- Save the clock tower.

87
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,160
He's letting you borrow the car
tomorrow night.

88
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,160
Check out that 4x4.

89
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,200
- That is hot.
- Back her up.

90
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,520
Someday, Jennifer. Someday.

91
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,000
Wouldn't it be great
to take that truck up to the lake ?

92
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,000
Throw a couple of sleeping bags
in the back.

93
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,400
Lie out underneath the stars.

94
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:40,240
- Stop it.
- What ?

95
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,440
Does your mom know ?
About tomorrow night ?

96
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,320
No, get out of town. My mom thinks
I'm going camping with the guys.

97
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:50,320
My mother would freak out
if she knew I was going with you.

98
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,320
I'd get the standard lecture about...

99
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,880
how she never did that stuff
when she was a kid.

100
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,600
Look, I think the woman was born a nun.

101
00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:00,280
She's just trying
to keep you respectable.

102
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,480
She's not doing a very good job.

103
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,790
Terrible.

104
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:07,240
Save the clock tower.
Save the clock tower.

105
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:11,200
Mayor Wilson is sponsoring
an initiative to replace that clock.

106
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,480
Thirty years ago, lightning struck that
clock tower and the clock hasn't run since.

107
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:20,160
We at the Hill Valley Preservation Society
think it should be preserved the way it is...

108
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,400
as part of our history and heritage.

109
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:24,240
- There's a quarter.
- Thanks.

110
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,160
Don't forget to take a flyer.

111
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,080
Save the clock tower !

112
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:30,880
Where were we ?

113
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,160
- Right about here.
- Jennifer !

114
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,200
It's my dad. I've got to go.

115
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,600
I'll call you tonight.

116
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,880
I'll be at my grandma's.

117
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,240
Here, let me give you the number.

118
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,080
'Bye.

119
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,360
<i>Bravo, Tango, Delta 6-2-9.</i>

120
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,080
<i>Tow for impoundment.
Any unit, please respond.</i>

121
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,160
Perfect. Just perfect.

122
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,480
I can't believe you'd loan me your car...

123
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,640
without telling me it had a blind spot.

124
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,240
I could've been killed.

125
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,720
Now, Biff, I never noticed...

126
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,400
that the car had any blind spot before
when I would drive it.

127
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,960
Hi, son.

128
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,720
Are you blind, McFly ?

129
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,960
How else do you explain
that wreck out there ?

130
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,160
Biff, can I assume...

131
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,200
that your insurance
is going to pay for the damage ?

132
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,560
My insurance ? It's your car.

133
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,400
Your insurance should pay.
Who's going to pay for this ?

134
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,320
I spilled beer when the car smashed
into me. Who'll pay my cleaning bill ?

135
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,360
And where's my reports ?

136
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:27,440
I haven't finished those up yet, but
I figured since they weren't due 'til...

137
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,400
Hello ? Hello ? Anybody home ?

138
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,400
Think, McFly. Think !

139
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,360
I got to have time to get them retyped.

140
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:39,400
Do you realize what would happen if I
hand in my reports in your handwriting ?

141
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,120
I'll get fired.

142
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,720
You wouldn't want that to happen,
would you ?

143
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,680
- Would you ?
- Of course not.

144
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,120
I wouldn't want that to happen.

145
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,600
Now, look.
I'll finish those reports tonight...

146
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,760
and I'll run them on over
first thing tomorrow.

147
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,840
Not too early. I sleep in Saturday.

148
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,760
Your shoe's untied.

149
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,360
Don't be so gullible, McFly.

150
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,320
Got the place fixed up nice.

151
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,320
I have your car towed to your house...

152
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,720
and all you got for me is lite beer ?

153
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,640
What are you looking at, butthead ?

154
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,680
Say hi to your mom for me.

155
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,480
I know what you're going to say, son...

156
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,160
and you're right.

157
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,600
You're right.

158
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,160
But...

159
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,840
Biff just happens to be my supervisor...

160
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,440
and I'm afraid I'm just not
very good at confrontations.

161
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,200
But the car, Dad.

162
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,160
I mean, he wrecked it.
He totaled it.

163
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,360
I needed that car tomorrow night, Dad.

164
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,520
Do you have any idea
how important this was to me ?

165
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,080
I know, and all I can say is, I'm...

166
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,160
I'm sorry.

167
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,480
Believe me, Marty, you're better off...

168
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:01,520
without having to worry
about all the aggravation...

169
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,720
and headaches of playing at that dance.

170
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:08,560
He's absolutely right.
The last thing you need is headaches.

171
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,880
Kids, we're going to have to
eat this cake by ourselves.

172
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,760
Your Uncle Joey
didn't make parole again.

173
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,120
It would be nice
if you all dropped him a line.

174
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,960
Uncle "Jailbird" Joey ?

175
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,520
He's your brother, Mom.

176
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,120
Yeah. It's a major embarrassment,
having an uncle in prison.

177
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,440
We all make mistakes in life, children.

178
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,200
Goddamn it. I'm late.

179
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,880
David, watch your mouth !

180
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,400
You come here and kiss your mother
before you go.

181
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,400
Come on, Mom.
Make it fast. I'll miss my bus.

182
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,080
See you later, Pop.

183
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,040
Time to change that oil.

184
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,480
I'm not your answering service.

185
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,840
While you were outside
pouting over the car...

186
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,840
Jennifer Parker called you twice.

187
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,400
I don't like her.

188
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,560
Any girl who calls up a boy
is just asking for trouble.

189
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,440
Mom. There's nothing wrong
with calling a boy.

190
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:13,160
I think it's terrible.
Girls chasing boys.

191
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,440
When I was your age,
I never chased a boy or called a boy or...

192
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,000
sat in a parked car with a boy.

193
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,160
Then how am I ever
supposed to meet anybody ?

194
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,240
Well, it'll just happen.

195
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,680
Like the way I met your father.

196
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:30,760
That was so stupid.
Grandpa hit him with the car.

197
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,480
It was meant to be.

198
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,000
Anyway...

199
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,600
if Grandpa hadn't hit him,
then none of you would have been born.

200
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,240
Yeah, well.

201
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,600
I don't understand what Dad was doing
in the middle of the street.

202
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,040
What was it, George ? Bird-watching ?

203
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,600
What, Lorraine ? What ?

204
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:51,440
Anyway, your Grandpa
hit him with the car...

205
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,600
and brought him into the house.

206
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,360
He seemed so helpless.

207
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,840
Like a little lost puppy,
and my heart just went out to him.

208
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,960
Yeah, we know.
You've told us this story a million times.

209
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,440
You felt sorry for him.

210
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,440
You decided to go with him
to the Fish Under the Sea dance.

211
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,440
No. It was
the Enchantment Under the Sea dance.

212
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,280
Our first date. I'll never forget it.

213
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:20,200
It was the night of that terrible
thunderstorm, remember, George ?

214
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:26,240
Your father kissed me
for the first time on that dance floor.

215
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,480
It was then that I realized...

216
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:33,600
that I was going to spend
the rest of my life with him.

217
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,320
Hello.

218
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,920
<i>- Marty, you didn't fall asleep, did you ?</i>
- Doc.

219
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,720
No. No, don't be silly.

220
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,640
<i>Listen, this is very important.
I forgot my video camera.</i>

221
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,480
<i>Can you pick it up at my place
on your way to the mall ?</i>

222
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:17,110
Yeah. I'm on my way.

223
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,280
Einstein ! Where's the doc, boy ?

224
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:39,880
- Marty ! You made it !
- Yeah.

225
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,280
Welcome to my latest experiment. This is
the one I've been waiting for all my life.

226
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,000
Well, it's a DeLorean...

227
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:49,720
All your questions will be answered.
Roll tape and we'll proceed.

228
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,160
- Is that a Devo suit ?
- Never mind that now.

229
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:54,350
- Not now.
- I'm ready.

230
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:58,720
Good evening. I'm Dr. Emmett Brown.
I'm in the Twin Pines Mall parking lot.

231
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,240
It's Saturday morning,
October 26, 1985, 1:18 a.m.

232
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,520
This is temporal experiment number one.

233
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,440
Come on, Einie. Get in there.

234
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,520
In you go. Sit down.

235
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,760
Put your seat belt on.

236
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,320
Please note that Einstein's clock...

237
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:25,240
is in precise synchronization
with my control watch.

238
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,480
- Got it ?
- Right. Check, Doc.

239
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,880
Have a good trip, Einstein.
Watch your head.

240
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,760
You got that thing
hooked up to the car ?

241
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,800
- Watch this.
- Yeah. Okay.

242
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,240
Got it.

243
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Jesus !

244
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,280
Not me ! The car !

245
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,320
If my calculations are correct...

246
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,160
when this baby hits 88 miles per hour...

247
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,880
you're going to see some serious shit.

248
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,760
Watch this !

249
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,320
What did I tell you ?

250
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,680
88 miles per hour !

251
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:26,320
The temporal displacement occurred
exactly 1:20 a.m. and zero seconds !

252
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,880
Jesus Christ !

253
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,320
Jesus Christ, Doc !
You disintegrated Einstein !

254
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,830
Calm down.
I didn't disintegrate anything.

255
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:38,960
The molecular structure of both Einstein
and the car are completely intact.

256
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,960
Then where the hell are they ?

257
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,960
The appropriate question is,
"When the hell are they ?"

258
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:48,240
Einstein has just become
the world's first time traveler.

259
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:51,320
I sent him into the future.

260
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,640
One minute into the future, to be exact.

261
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,760
At precisely 1:21 a.m.
and zero seconds...

262
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,720
we shall catch up with him
and the time machine.

263
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,960
Wait a minute, Doc.

264
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:10,400
Are you telling me that
you built a time machine...

265
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,600
- out of a DeLorean ?
- The way I see it...

266
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:17,520
if you're going to build a time machine
into a car, why not do it with style ?

267
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,800
Besides, the stainless-steel construction
made the flux dispersal...

268
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,400
Look out !

269
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:09,200
- What ? Is it hot ?
- It's cold. Damn cold.

270
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,920
Einstein, you little devil !

271
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:20,680
Einstein's clock is exactly one minute
behind mine and still ticking !

272
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,680
- He's okay.
- He's fine.

273
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,920
He's completely unaware
that anything happened.

274
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,560
As far as he's concerned,
the trip was instantaneous.

275
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,160
That's why his watch is exactly
one minute behind mine.

276
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:36,800
He skipped over that minute to
instantly arrive at this moment in time.

277
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,240
I'll show you how it works.

278
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,600
First, you turn the time circuits on.

279
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:51,080
This tells you where you're going, this
where you are and this where you were.

280
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,600
Input your destination time
on this keypad.

281
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:57,080
Say you want to see the signing
of the Declaration of lndependence.

282
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,080
Or witness the birth of Christ.

283
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,560
Here's a red-letter date
in the history of science.

284
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:09,280
November 5, 1955.

285
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,360
Yes, of course.

286
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:17,240
November 5, 1955.

287
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,600
What happened ?

288
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,960
That was the day I invented time travel.

289
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,840
I remember it vividly.

290
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,840
I was standing on my toilet
hanging a clock.

291
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,640
The porcelain was wet.
I slipped, hit my head on the sink.

292
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,560
When I came to, I had a revelation.

293
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:35,120
A vision. A picture in my head.
A picture of this.

294
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,200
This is what makes time travel possible.

295
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,480
The flux capacitor.

296
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:41,920
Flux capacitor ?

297
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:46,320
It's taken almost 30 years and my family
fortune to realize the vision of that day.

298
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,960
My God, has it been that long ?

299
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,040
Things have certainly changed
around here.

300
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,880
I remember when this was all farmland
as far as the eye could see.

301
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,720
Old man Peabody owned all of this.

302
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:05,640
He had this crazy idea
about breeding pine trees.

303
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,600
This is...
This is heavy-duty, Doc. This is great.

304
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,560
Does it run
on regular unleaded gasoline ?

305
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:19,280
Unfortunately, no. It requires something
with a little more kick. Plutonium.

306
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,560
Plutonium. Wait a minute.

307
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,280
Are you telling me
that this sucker is nuclear ?

308
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,880
Keep rolling there.

309
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,720
No, this sucker's electrical...

310
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:31,760
but I need a nuclear reaction to generate
the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity I need.

311
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:35,000
You don't just walk into a store
and buy plutonium.

312
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,400
Did you rip that off ?

313
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,800
Of course. From a group of Libyans.
They wanted me to build them a bomb.

314
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:47,120
I took the plutonium and gave them a
bomb casing full of pinball machine parts.

315
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,040
- Come on. Let's get you a radiation suit.
- Jesus !

316
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,880
It's safe now. Everything's lead-lined.

317
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,520
Don't lose those tapes now.

318
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,480
I need that as a record.

319
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,760
Let's put this back here. There we go.

320
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,800
Almost forgot my luggage.

321
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,520
Who knows if they got
cotton underwear in the future.

322
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:38,480
- I'm allergic to all synthetics.
- The future.

323
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,520
- That's where you're going.
- Right.

324
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:44,720
25 years. I've always dreamed of seeing
the future, looking beyond my years...

325
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,920
seeing the progress of mankind.

326
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,160
Why not ?

327
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,480
I'll also be able to see
who wins the next 25 World Series.

328
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,840
Look me up when you get there.

329
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,960
Indeed I will. Roll 'em.

330
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,760
I, Dr. Emmett Brown...

331
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,480
am about to embark
on an historic journey.

332
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,360
What am I thinking of ?

333
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,520
I almost forgot
to bring extra plutonium.

334
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,040
How do I expect to get back ?
One pellet, one trip.

335
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,080
I must be out of my mind.

336
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,120
What is it ?

337
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,360
My God.

338
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,480
They found me.
I don't know how, but they found me.

339
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,680
- Run for it, Marty !
- Who ?

340
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,280
Who do you think ? The Libyans !

341
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,120
Holy shit !

342
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,520
I'll draw their fire !

343
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,680
Doc, wait !

344
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,160
Bastards !

345
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,320
Go !

346
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,400
Come on ! Move ! Goddamn it !

347
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,240
Jesus !

348
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,960
Holy shit !

349
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:55,360
Let's see if you bastards can do 90.

350
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,320
Pa, what is it ?

351
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,840
What is it, Pa ?

352
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Looks like an airplane without wings.

353
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:54,560
That ain't no airplane. Look.

354
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,840
Don't look !

355
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,520
Listen...

356
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,400
Hello.

357
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,680
Excuse me.

358
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,600
Sorry about your barn.

359
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,880
It's already mutated into human form !
Shoot it !

360
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:50,040
Take that, you mutated son of a bitch !

361
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,640
Wait !

362
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,360
Shoot it, Pa !

363
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,520
My pine ! Why you...

364
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:09,760
You space bastard ! You killed my pine !

365
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,800
Okay, McFly.

366
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:18,000
Get a grip on yourself.
It's all a dream.

367
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,760
Just a very intense dream.

368
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:05,080
- Listen, you got to help me.
- Don't stop, Wilbur !

369
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,000
It can't be.

370
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,400
This is nuts.

371
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,840
Come on.

372
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,040
Perfect.

373
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:17,760
<i>Remember, fellow citizens,
the future is in your hands.</i>

374
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,400
<i>If you believe in progress,
re-elect Mayor Red Thomas.</i>

375
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,640
<i>Progress is his middle name.</i>

376
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:26,190
<i>Mayor Red Thomas' progress platform...</i>

377
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,670
<i>means more jobs, better education...</i>

378
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:31,670
<i>bigger civic improvements
and lower taxes.</i>

379
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:35,280
<i>On election day,
cast your vote for a proven leader.</i>

380
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,640
<i>Re-elect Mayor Red Thomas.</i>

381
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,760
This has got to be a dream.

382
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:01,080
Hey, kid. You jump ship ?

383
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,320
- What ?
- What's with the life preserver ?

384
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,960
I want to use the phone.

385
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,080
It's in the back.

386
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:16,920
Brown.

387
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,320
Great. You're alive.

388
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,400
Come on.

389
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:44,230
- Do you know where 1640 Riverside...
- Are you going to order, kid ?

390
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:49,230
Give me a Tab.

391
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,840
I can't give you a tab
unless you order something.

392
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,880
Right. Give me a Pepsi Free.

393
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:56,520
You want a Pepsi, pal,
you're going to pay for it.

394
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:59,600
Just give me something
without any sugar in it, okay ?

395
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,600
Something without sugar.

396
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:10,280
McFly.

397
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,160
What are you doing ?

398
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,080
Biff.

399
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,710
I'm talking to you, McFly,
you Irish bug !

400
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:22,480
- Biff. Guys. How are you doing ?
- You got my homework finished ?

401
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:25,800
Actually, I figured
since it wasn't due 'til Monday...

402
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,640
Hello ? Hello ? Anybody home ?

403
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:30,960
Think, McFly. Think !

404
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,840
I got to have time to recopy it.

405
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,440
You realize what would happen if I hand
in my homework in your handwriting ?

406
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:38,320
I'll get kicked out of school.

407
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,800
You wouldn't want that to happen,
would you ?

408
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,560
- Would you ?
- Of course not.

409
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:46,480
- No.
- I wouldn't want that to happen.

410
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:50,280
- What are you looking at, butthead ?
- Get a load of his life preserver.

411
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,120
Dork thinks he's going to drown.

412
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,000
How about my homework, McFly ?

413
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,670
Okay, Biff.

414
00:37:56,840 --> 00:38:01,160
I'll finish that up tonight and then I'll
bring it over first thing tomorrow morning.

415
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:04,840
Not too early. I sleep in Sundays.
Your shoe's untied !

416
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,440
Don't be so gullible, McFly.

417
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:11,040
- I don't want to see you in here again.
- Okay. All right. Bye-bye.

418
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,600
- What ?
- You're George McFly !

419
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,840
Yeah. Who are you ?

420
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,440
Why do you let those boys
push you around like that for ?

421
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,880
They're bigger than me.

422
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,160
Stand tall.
Have some respect for yourself.

423
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:47,560
If you let people walk over you now,
they'll walk over you the rest of your life.

424
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:50,710
Look at me. You think
I'll spend my life in this slop house ?

425
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,600
- Watch it, Goldie.
- No, sir !

426
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:55,040
I'll do something.
I'll go to night school.

427
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:57,230
One day, I'm going to be somebody.

428
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,120
That's right. He's going to be mayor.

429
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,560
Yeah, I'm...

430
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:02,520
Mayor !

431
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:06,920
Now that's a good idea !
I could run for mayor.

432
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:10,600
- A colored mayor. That'll be the day.
- Wait and see. I will be mayor.

433
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:13,040
I'll be the most powerful man
in Hill Valley...

434
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:14,920
and I'm going to clean up this town.

435
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:17,480
Good. You can start
by sweeping the floor.

436
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,280
Mayor Goldie Wilson.

437
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,190
I like the sound of that.

438
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:39,440
Hey, Dad ! George !
Hey, you on the bike !

439
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,480
He's a peeping Tom !

440
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,160
Dad !

441
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,320
Wait a minute. Who are you ?

442
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:38,120
Stella ! Another one of these damn kids
jumped in front of my car !

443
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:41,670
Come out here !
Help me take him in the house !

444
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,440
Mom ?

445
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:50,080
That you ?

446
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,840
There, there, now.

447
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,440
Just relax.

448
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,360
You've been asleep
for almost nine hours now.

449
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,840
I had a horrible nightmare.

450
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,800
I dreamed that I went back in time.

451
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,560
It was terrible.

452
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,560
Well...

453
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:14,230
you're safe and sound now
back in good old 1955.

454
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,840
1955 ?

455
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,920
You're my...

456
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:25,960
My name is Lorraine.

457
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,960
- Lorraine Baines ?
- Yeah.

458
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,520
But you're...

459
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:33,040
You're so...

460
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:36,230
You're so thin !

461
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,360
Just relax, Calvin.
You got a big bruise on your head.

462
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:45,280
Where are my pants ?

463
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,960
Over there...

464
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:49,040
on my hope chest.

465
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:53,080
I've never seen
purple underwear before, Calvin.

466
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:56,280
Calvin ?
Why do you keep calling me Calvin ?

467
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,040
That is your name, isn't it ?
Calvin Klein.

468
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:01,800
It's written all over your underwear.

469
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,960
I guess they call you Cal, huh ?

470
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,080
No, actually, people...

471
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,230
call me Marty.

472
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,760
Pleased to meet you, Calvin...

473
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,440
Marty...

474
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:17,960
Klein.

475
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:27,520
- Do you mind if I sit here ?
- No. Fine.

476
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,160
No. Good. Fine. Good.

477
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,400
That's a big bruise you have there.

478
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,920
Lorraine, are you up there ?

479
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:39,840
Oh, my God ! It's my mother !

480
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:42,800
Quick ! Put your pants back on !

481
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,960
Marty, how long have you been in port ?

482
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:55,440
- Excuse me ?
- I guessed you're a sailor.

483
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,840
That's why you wear that life preserver.

484
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,360
Coast guard.

485
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:03,520
Sam, here's the young man you hit
with your car. He's all right. Thank God.

486
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,880
What were you doing
in the middle of the street ?

487
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:08,520
Don't pay attention to him.
He's in one of his moods.

488
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:11,360
Quit fiddling with that thing.
Come in here to dinner.

489
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,280
You already know Lorraine.

490
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,320
This is Milton, this is Sally...

491
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:19,360
that's Toby, and over there
in the playpen is little baby Joey.

492
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,280
So, you're my uncle Joey.

493
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:26,440
Better get used to these bars, kid.

494
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:30,480
Yes. Joey just loves
being in his playpen.

495
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:34,080
He cries whenever we take him out,
so we leave him in there all the time.

496
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,560
Well, Marty, I hope you like meat loaf.

497
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:39,600
- Well, listen, I really ought to...
- Sit here, Marty.

498
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:44,520
Sam, stop fiddling with that thing
and come in here and eat your dinner.

499
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,000
Look at it roll.

500
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,960
Now we can watch
Jackie Gleason while we eat.

501
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:02,040
Our first television set.
Dad just picked it up today.

502
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:04,480
Do you have a television ?

503
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,640
Well, yeah.
You know, we have two of them.

504
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:10,400
Wow ! You must be rich.

505
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:14,760
Honey, he's teasing you.
Nobody has two television sets.

506
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:23,000
I've seen this one. This is a classic.

507
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,960
This is where Ralph dresses up
as a man from space.

508
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:29,280
What do you mean, you've seen this ?
It's brand-new.

509
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:32,120
Yeah, well, I saw it on a rerun.

510
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:34,160
What's a rerun ?

511
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:35,880
You'll find out.

512
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,160
You know, Marty,
you look so familiar to me.

513
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:40,160
Do I know your mother ?

514
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,200
Yeah, I think maybe you do.

515
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:46,480
Then I'll call her.
I don't want her to worry about you.

516
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:47,800
You can't.

517
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,960
That is, nobody's home.

518
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:55,800
Yet.

519
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,000
Listen.

520
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:01,520
Do you know where Riverside Drive is ?

521
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:05,360
It's on the other end of town.
A block past Maple. East end of town.

522
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:08,800
A block past Maple.
That's John F. Kennedy Drive.

523
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,240
Who the hell is John F. Kennedy ?

524
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:13,720
Mother ?

525
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:16,600
With Marty's parents out of town...

526
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,480
don't you think
he ought to spend the night ?

527
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:21,880
After all,
Dad almost killed him with the car.

528
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:23,920
That's true, Marty.

529
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:27,560
I think you should spend the night.
I think you're our responsibility.

530
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:30,960
- Well, gee, I don't know.
- He can sleep in my room.

531
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:32,880
I got to go !

532
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:35,240
Thanks very much. You were all great.

533
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:36,760
See you all later.

534
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:39,320
Much later.

535
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:45,600
He's a very strange young man.

536
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:47,120
He's an idiot.

537
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:50,440
Comes from upbringing.
His parents are probably idiots, too.

538
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:54,640
Lorraine, you ever have a kid
who acts that way, I'll disown you.

539
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:34,600
Don't say a word.

540
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:38,200
No names. I want
to know nothing about you.

541
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:39,840
- Listen, Doc...
- Quiet !

542
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,520
Don't tell me anything.

543
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:43,600
- You got to help...
- Quiet.

544
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:48,040
I'm going to read your thoughts.

545
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:51,520
Let's see now.
You come here from a great distance ?

546
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:54,040
- Yeah. Exactly.
- Don't tell me !

547
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:57,240
You want me to subscribe
to the "Saturday Evening Post".

548
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:59,800
- No.
- Not a word now !

549
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,040
Quiet.

550
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:04,400
Donations.

551
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,440
You want me to make a donation...

552
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:08,800
to the Coast Guard Youth Auxiliary.

553
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,200
I'm from the future.

554
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:17,120
I came here in a time machine
that you invented.

555
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:22,080
Now, I need your help
to get back to the year 1985.

556
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:24,880
My God !

557
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:31,400
Do you know what this means ?

558
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:37,080
It means that
this damn thing doesn't work at all !

559
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:41,320
You got to help me. You are the only one
who knows how your time machine works.

560
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:42,960
Time machine ?

561
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,560
I haven't invented any time machine.

562
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:48,920
Okay. I'll prove it to you.

563
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:52,440
Look at my driver's license.
Expires 1987.

564
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:55,920
Look at my birthday.
I haven't even been born yet.

565
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,040
And look at this picture.

566
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:00,320
It's my brother, my sister and me.

567
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:03,480
Look at her sweatshirt, Doc.
"Class of 1984" ?

568
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:08,240
Pretty mediocre photographic fakery.
They cut off your brother's hair.

569
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:11,400
I'm telling the truth.
You got to believe me.

570
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:14,240
Then tell me, future boy...

571
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:18,480
who's president of the United States
in 1985 ?

572
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:21,960
- Ronald Reagan.
- Ronald Reagan ? The actor ?

573
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:25,920
Then who's vice president ?
Jerry Lewis ?

574
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:30,400
- I suppose Jane Wyman is the First Lady.
- Wait, Doc !

575
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:32,640
And Jack Benny is treasury secretary.

576
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,000
Listen to me.

577
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:37,360
I've had enough jokes for one evening.
Good night, future boy !

578
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:38,760
No, wait, Doc.

579
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:42,920
The bruise on your head.
I know how that happened. You told me.

580
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:45,520
You were standing on your toilet
hanging a clock...

581
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:47,760
and you fell
and hit your head on the sink.

582
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:51,360
That's when you got the idea
for the flux capacitor which...

583
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:54,560
is what makes time travel possible.

584
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:11,040
There's something wrong with
the starter, so I hid it here.

585
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:23,080
After I fell off my toilet...

586
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:25,440
I drew this.

587
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:30,640
The flux capacitor.

588
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:49,480
It works !

589
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:53,240
It works !

590
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:56,720
I finally invent something that works !

591
00:49:57,880 --> 00:49:59,640
You bet your ass it works.

592
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:03,360
We've got to sneak this back
to my laboratory.

593
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:05,520
We've got to get you home !

594
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:07,600
This is it.

595
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:11,600
<i>Never mind that now.</i>

596
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:14,000
Why, that's me ! Look at me !

597
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:16,240
- I'm an old man !
<i>- I'm Dr. Emmett Brown.</i>

598
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:18,280
<i>I'm in the Twin Pines Mall parking lot.</i>

599
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:20,320
Thank God, I've still got my hair.

600
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:22,320
What's this thing I'm wearing ?

601
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:24,480
This is a radiation suit.

602
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:26,240
Radiation suit ?

603
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:29,480
Of course. 'Cause of all the fallout
from the atomic wars.

604
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:33,320
This is truly amazing.

605
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:36,000
A portable television studio.

606
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:39,880
No wonder your president has to be
an actor. He has to look good on TV.

607
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:41,880
This is the part coming up.

608
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:47,120
<i>This sucker's electrical but I need a nuclear
reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts...</i>

609
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:49,200
What did I just say ?

610
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:55,360
<i>...this sucker's electrical,
but I need a nuclear reaction...</i>

611
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:59,200
<i>- to generate the 1.21 gigawatts of...</i>
- 1.21 gigawatts !

612
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:02,640
1.21 gigawatts.

613
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,240
Great Scott !

614
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,760
What the hell is a gigawatt ?

615
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:13,440
How could I have been so careless ?

616
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:15,360
1.21 gigawatts !

617
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:17,960
Tom, how am I going to generate
that kind of power ?

618
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:19,560
It can't be done, can it ?

619
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:22,880
Doc, look.
All we need is a little plutonium.

620
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:27,320
I'm sure that in 1985 plutonium is
available in every corner drugstore...

621
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:30,080
but in 1955,
it's a little hard to come by.

622
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:33,040
Marty, I'm sorry,
but I'm afraid you're stuck here.

623
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:36,640
Doc, stuck here ? I can't be stuck here.

624
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:38,880
I got a life in 1985.

625
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:41,000
- I got a girl.
- Is she pretty ?

626
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:43,120
Doc, she's beautiful.

627
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:46,040
She's crazy about me. Look at this.

628
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:48,160
Look what she wrote here.

629
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,080
That says it all.

630
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:53,360
Doc, you're my only hope.

631
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,080
Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power
source capable of generating...

632
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:00,240
1.21 gigawatts of electricity
is a bolt of lightning.

633
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:03,880
- What did you say ?
- A bolt of lightning.

634
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:07,520
Unfortunately, you never know
when or where it's ever going to strike.

635
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:10,640
We do now.

636
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:16,840
This is it !

637
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:19,640
This is the answer.

638
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:22,160
It says here that a bolt of lightning...

639
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:26,280
is going to strike the clock tower
at 10:04 p.m. next Saturday night !

640
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:33,080
If we could somehow harness
this lightning...

641
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:37,440
channel it into the flux capacitor...

642
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,160
it just might work.

643
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:44,600
Next Saturday night
we're sending you back to the future !

644
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:47,400
All right. Saturday's good.

645
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:51,080
I can spend a week in 1955.
I can hang out. You can show me around.

646
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:54,160
That is out of the question.
You must not leave this house.

647
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:56,200
You must not see or talk to anybody.

648
00:52:56,360 --> 00:53:00,320
Anything you do can have repercussions
on future events. Do you understand ?

649
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:03,200
Yeah. Sure. Okay.

650
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:08,400
Have you interacted with anybody else
today besides me ?

651
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:13,400
Yeah, well, I might've sort of
bumped into my parents.

652
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:16,840
Great Scott ! Let me see that photograph
again of your brother.

653
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:23,920
Just as I thought. This proves my theory.
Look at your brother.

654
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:28,040
His head's gone.
It's like it's been erased.

655
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:31,640
Erased from existence.

656
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:39,640
They really cleaned this place up.
Looks brand-new.

657
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:43,040
According to my theory, you interfered
with your parents' first meeting.

658
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:46,240
If they don't meet, they won't fall
in love, get married or have kids.

659
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:48,640
That's why your brother's disappearing.

660
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:52,040
Your sister will follow, and unless
you repair the damage, you're next.

661
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:55,000
- Sounds heavy.
- Weight has nothing to do with it.

662
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:56,600
Which one's your pop ?

663
00:53:58,120 --> 00:53:59,160
That's him.

664
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:06,680
Very funny.
You guys are being real mature.

665
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:08,640
Maybe you were adopted.

666
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:11,080
Okay, real mature, guys.

667
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:14,440
- Okay, pick up my books.
- McFly.

668
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:15,920
That's Strickland.

669
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,600
Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair ?

670
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:21,120
Shape up, man. You're a slacker.

671
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:24,280
Do you want to be a slacker
for the rest of your life ?

672
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:28,440
- What did your mother see in him ?
- I don't know.

673
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:32,200
I guess she felt sorry for him
'cause her dad hit him with the car.

674
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:35,000
He hit me with the car.

675
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:37,040
That's the Florence Nightingale effect.

676
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:40,480
It happens in hospitals when
nurses fall in love with their patients.

677
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:41,840
Go to it, kid.

678
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:45,320
George, buddy.

679
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:47,960
I have been looking all over for you.

680
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:50,760
You remember me, the guy
who saved your life the other day ?

681
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:54,520
- Yeah.
- There's somebody I'd like you to meet.

682
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:01,920
Calvin !

683
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:08,680
Hi. It's really a pleasure to meet you.

684
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:12,320
- How's your head ?
- Good. Fine.

685
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:15,910
I've been worried about you
ever since you ran off the other night.

686
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:17,360
Are you okay ?

687
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:21,040
- I'm sorry. I have to go.
- Come on !

688
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,640
Isn't he a dreamboat ?

689
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:30,760
- She didn't even look at him.
- This is more serious than I thought.

690
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:33,840
Your mother is infatuated with you
instead of your father.

691
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,040
Wait a minute, Doc.

692
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:39,560
Are you trying to tell me
that my mother has got the hots for me ?

693
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:42,160
- Precisely.
- This is heavy.

694
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:44,400
There's that word again. "Heavy".

695
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:48,440
Why are things so heavy in the future ?
Is there a problem with the Earth's gravity ?

696
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:51,720
The only way we're going to
get them to mate is if they're alone.

697
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:54,200
You've got to get them to interact...

698
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:56,440
in some sort of social...

699
00:55:57,840 --> 00:55:59,960
- You mean like a date ?
- Right !

700
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:03,120
What kind of date ?
What do kids do in the '50s ?

701
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:05,800
They're your parents.
You must know them.

702
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:09,400
What are their common interests ?
What do they like to do together ?

703
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:10,920
Nothing.

704
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:13,880
Look ! There's a rhythmic
ceremonial ritual coming up.

705
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:17,360
The Enchantment Under the Sea dance !
They're supposed to go to this.

706
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:20,360
- That's where they kiss for the first time.
- All right, kid.

707
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:24,000
You stick to your father like glue
and make sure he takes her to that dance.

708
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:26,240
George, buddy...

709
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:29,680
remember that girl
I introduced you to, Lorraine ?

710
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:37,200
What are you writing ?

711
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:39,520
Stories.

712
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:43,440
Science fiction stories
about visitors...

713
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:46,840
coming down to Earth
from other planets.

714
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:52,270
Get out of town !
I didn't know you did anything creative.

715
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:55,480
- Let me read some.
- No, no.

716
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:58,360
I never let anybody read my stories.

717
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:00,400
Why not ?

718
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:04,990
What if they didn't like them ?
What if they told me I was no good ?

719
00:57:06,990 --> 00:57:10,240
I guess that would be pretty hard
for somebody to understand.

720
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:13,400
No. No, not hard at all.

721
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:17,040
So anyway, George. About Lorraine.

722
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:19,680
She really likes you.

723
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:23,430
She told me to tell you
that she wants you to ask her...

724
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:25,440
to the Enchantment
Under the Sea dance.

725
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:26,520
- Really ?
- Yeah.

726
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:29,400
All you got to do is go over there
and ask her.

727
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:32,680
Right here, right now,
in the cafeteria ?

728
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:36,200
What if she said no ? I don't know
if I could take that kind of rejection.

729
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,640
Besides, I think she'd rather go
with somebody else.

730
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:44,080
Who ?

731
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:50,720
- Don't kid around. Come on.
- Come on. Leave.

732
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:52,720
You know you want it.

733
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:54,720
You know you want me to give it to you.

734
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:57,560
Shut your filthy mouth.
I'm not that kind of girl.

735
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:01,000
Maybe you are
and you just don't know it yet.

736
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:02,960
Get your meat hooks off of me.

737
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:05,800
You heard her.
She said, get your meat hooks...

738
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:07,520
off.

739
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:09,920
Please.

740
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:12,480
What's it to you, butthead ?

741
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:15,800
You been looking for a fight.

742
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:28,440
Since you're new here,
I'm going to cut you a break...

743
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,000
today.

744
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:33,480
So why don't you make like a tree...

745
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:35,240
and get out of here.

746
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:51,320
Why do you keep following me ?

747
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:55,920
George, I'm telling you, if you
do not ask Lorraine to that dance...

748
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:58,920
- I'll regret it for the rest of my life.
- I can't go.

749
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:02,040
I'll miss my favorite TV program,
<i>Science Fiction Theatre</i>.

750
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:05,360
Yeah, but Lorraine wants to go with you.

751
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:07,070
Give her a break.

752
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:10,720
I'm just not ready
to ask Lorraine out to the dance...

753
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:14,280
and not you
or anybody else on this planet...

754
00:59:14,630 --> 00:59:16,630
is going to make me change my mind.

755
00:59:23,630 --> 00:59:25,360
<i>Science Fiction Theatre</i>.

756
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:57,000
Who are you ?

757
01:00:02,190 --> 01:00:04,120
<i>"Silence, Earthling.</i>

758
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:07,800
<i>My name is Darth Vader.</i>

759
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:15,960
<i>I am an extraterrestrial
from the planet Vulcan.</i>

760
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:24,240
- Marty ! Marty !
- George, buddy.

761
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:26,680
You weren't at school.
What have you been doing ?

762
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:29,520
I overslept. I need your help.

763
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:32,480
I have to ask Lorraine out,
but I don't know how to do it.

764
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:34,920
Keep your pants on.
She's over in the cafe.

765
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:37,000
God ! How do you... ?

766
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:41,360
What made you change your mind ?

767
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:44,200
Last night, Darth Vader came down
from planet Vulcan...

768
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:48,000
and told me that if I didn't
take Lorraine out, he'd melt my brain.

769
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:51,080
Let's just keep this brain-melting stuff
to ourselves, okay ?

770
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:54,280
- Yeah. Yeah.
- All right. There she is.

771
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:56,360
Just go in there and invite her.

772
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:59,040
But I don't know what to say.
Say anything.

773
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:02,440
Say whatever's natural, the first thing
that comes into your mind.

774
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:05,440
Nothing's coming to my mind.

775
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:07,600
Jesus. It's a wonder I was even born.

776
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:10,120
- What ? What ?
- Nothing.

777
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:14,120
Tell her destiny brought you together.

778
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:17,880
Tell her she is the most beautiful girl
you have ever seen in the world.

779
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:19,640
Girls like that stuff.

780
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:23,280
- What are you doing ?
- I'm writing this down. This is good stuff.

781
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:26,320
- Okay. Can you take care of that ?
- Right.

782
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:46,360
Lou, give me a milk.

783
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:48,960
Chocolate.

784
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:07,760
My density...

785
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:10,240
has popped me to you.

786
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:12,120
What ?

787
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:16,600
What I meant to say was...

788
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:19,360
Wait a minute.
Don't I know you from somewhere ?

789
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:25,120
Yes. I'm George. George McFly.

790
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:27,400
I'm your density.

791
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:29,600
I mean...

792
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:32,200
your destiny.

793
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:43,280
I thought I told you
never to come in here.

794
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:47,760
Well, it's going to cost you.

795
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:50,400
How much money you got on you ?

796
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:52,720
How much do you want, Biff ?

797
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,280
All right, punk.

798
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:04,800
- Now I'm going to...
- Biff. What's that ?

799
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:14,470
That's Calvin Klein.
My God, he's a dream.

800
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:17,960
Kid ! Kid, stop ! Stop !

801
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:22,350
I'll get it back to you.

802
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:24,440
You broke it !

803
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:26,520
Come back here !

804
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:29,840
Look at him go !

805
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:32,350
Get him !

806
01:03:45,470 --> 01:03:47,470
To the car ! Go !

807
01:03:53,560 --> 01:03:56,160
- What's that thing he's on ?
- A board with wheels.

808
01:03:56,350 --> 01:03:57,800
He's an absolute dream.

809
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:00,520
- Come on, come on !
- Look out for the car !

810
01:04:32,590 --> 01:04:33,960
I'm going to ram him.

811
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:42,470
Shit !

812
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:08,080
Thanks a lot, kid.

813
01:05:09,470 --> 01:05:11,470
I'm going to get that son of a bitch.

814
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:14,710
- Where does he come from ?
- Yeah, where does he live ?

815
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:16,800
I don't know...

816
01:05:17,350 --> 01:05:19,200
but I'm going to find out.

817
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:25,520
<i>My God.</i>

818
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:28,960
<i>They found me.
I don't know how, but they found me.</i>

819
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:30,710
<i>Run for it, Marty !</i>

820
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:36,320
<i>My God.</i>

821
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:40,080
<i>They found me.
I don't know how, but they found me.</i>

822
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:41,600
<i>Run for it, Marty !</i>

823
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:47,400
Hi, Marty. I didn't hear you come in.

824
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:50,760
Fascinating device, this video unit.

825
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:53,360
Listen, Doc.

826
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:57,960
- I haven't told you about...
- One shouldn't know about his own destiny.

827
01:05:58,200 --> 01:05:59,640
- You don't understand.
- I do.

828
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:02,120
If I know too much
I endanger my own existence...

829
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:04,560
just as you've endangered yours.

830
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:08,360
You're right.

831
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:11,160
Let me show you my plan
for sending you home.

832
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:13,120
Please excuse the crudity of this model.

833
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:15,600
I didn't have time to build it to scale
or paint it.

834
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:17,760
- It's good.
- Thank you.

835
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:23,520
We run industrial-strength electrical
cable from the top of the clock tower...

836
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:27,040
down, suspending it over the street
between these two lampposts.

837
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:31,200
Meanwhile, we've outfitted the time
vehicle with this big pole and hook...

838
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:34,280
which runs directly
into the flux capacitor.

839
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:37,000
At the calculated moment...

840
01:06:37,640 --> 01:06:39,640
you start off from down the street...

841
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:43,520
driving directly toward the cable,
accelerating to 88 miles per hour.

842
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:47,240
According to the flyer, at precisely
10:04 p.m. this Saturday night...

843
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:50,800
lightning will strike the clock tower,
electrifying the cable...

844
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,080
as the connecting hook makes contact...

845
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:56,600
thereby sending 1.21 gigawatts
into the flux capacitor...

846
01:06:57,120 --> 01:06:59,000
and sending you back to 1985.

847
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:02,600
All right, now. Watch this.
You wind up the car and release it.

848
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:06,680
I'll simulate the lightning.

849
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:15,840
Ready.

850
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:26,480
Set.

851
01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:32,320
Release.

852
01:07:50,080 --> 01:07:52,280
You're instilling me
with a lot of confidence.

853
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:55,800
Don't worry. I'll take care of ideas.
You take care of your pop.

854
01:07:57,120 --> 01:07:58,080
By the way...

855
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:00,200
what happened today ?
Did he ask her out ?

856
01:08:00,360 --> 01:08:02,240
- I think so.
- What did she say ?

857
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:14,600
It's your mom ! She's tracked you down !
Quick ! Let's cover the time machine.

858
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:29,760
Hi, Cal... Marty.

859
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:34,960
How did you know I was here ?

860
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:37,360
I followed you.

861
01:08:39,080 --> 01:08:41,040
This is my doc... My uncle...

862
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:43,720
Doc Brown.

863
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:51,920
Marty, this may seem a little forward...

864
01:08:52,280 --> 01:08:54,360
but I was kind of wondering...

865
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:57,040
if you'd ask me to the...

866
01:08:57,880 --> 01:09:00,640
Enchantment Under the Sea dance
on Saturday ?

867
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:03,720
You mean...

868
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:05,920
You mean nobody's asked you ?

869
01:09:08,360 --> 01:09:09,560
Not yet.

870
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:14,040
- What about George ?
- George McFly ?

871
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:20,360
He's kind of cute and all, but not...

872
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:22,280
Well...

873
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:25,200
I think a man should be strong...

874
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:29,200
so he can stand up for himself...

875
01:09:30,320 --> 01:09:32,520
and protect the woman he loves.

876
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:38,000
Don't you ?

877
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:43,320
I still don't understand.

878
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:46,080
How am I supposed to
go to the dance with her...

879
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:48,800
if she's already going
to the dance with you ?

880
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,480
Well, because, George,
she wants to go with you.

881
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:53,360
She just doesn't know it yet.

882
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:56,320
That's why we got to show her
that you, George, are a fighter.

883
01:09:56,520 --> 01:09:59,720
You're somebody who stands up
for yourself and will protect her.

884
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:02,840
Yeah, but I've never picked a fight
in my entire life.

885
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:05,640
Look, you're not going
to be picking a fight, Dad...

886
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:07,400
Dad-dad-daddy-o.

887
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:10,040
You're coming to her rescue, right ?

888
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:13,040
Let's go over the plan again.
8:55, where are you going to be ?

889
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:14,760
I'm going to be at the dance.

890
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:17,720
- And where am I going to be ?
- You'll be in the car, with her.

891
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:20,680
Right around 9:00,
she's going to get very angry with me.

892
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:23,080
Why is she going to get angry with you ?

893
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:27,480
Well, because, George, nice girls get
angry when guys take advantage of them.

894
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:34,120
- You're going to go touch her on her...
- No. No, George, look.

895
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:36,880
It's just an act, right ?

896
01:10:37,240 --> 01:10:40,680
So, 9:00, you're strolling
through the parking lot.

897
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:44,160
You see us struggling in the car.

898
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:47,360
You walk up, you open the door,
and you say...

899
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:50,520
Your line, George.

900
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:56,360
Hey, you, get your damn hands off her !

901
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:00,920
- You really think I ought to swear ?
- Definitely.

902
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:02,600
Goddamn it, George, swear.

903
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:05,440
Okay. So now you come up.
You punch me in the stomach.

904
01:11:05,640 --> 01:11:07,400
I'm out for the count, right ?

905
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:10,560
And you and Lorraine
live happily ever after.

906
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:12,840
You make it sound so easy.

907
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:15,600
I just... I wish I wasn't so scared.

908
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:19,120
There's nothing to be scared of.
All it takes is self-confidence.

909
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:21,520
You know, if you put your mind to it...

910
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:23,840
you can accomplish anything.

911
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:27,960
<i>Hill Valley weather this Saturday night.</i>

912
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:30,720
<i>Mostly clear,
with some scattered clouds.</i>

913
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:32,640
<i>Lows tonight, in the upper forties.</i>

914
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:35,240
Are you sure about this storm ?

915
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:39,400
Since when can weathermen predict
the weather, let alone the future ?

916
01:11:39,640 --> 01:11:42,120
You know, Marty,
I'm going to be very sad to see you go.

917
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:45,680
You've made a difference in my life,
given me something to shoot for.

918
01:11:45,910 --> 01:11:49,720
Just knowing
that I'm going to be around to see 1985.

919
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,760
That I'm going to succeed in this !

920
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:54,680
That I'm going to have a chance
to travel through time !

921
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:03,000
It's going to be hard
waiting 30 years to talk to you...

922
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:05,910
about everything that's happened
in the past few days.

923
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:08,320
I'm really going to miss you, Marty.

924
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:11,240
I'm going to miss you.

925
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:18,520
- Doc, about the future...
- No !

926
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:23,520
We've agreed that information about
the future can be extremely dangerous.

927
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:27,480
Even if your intentions are good,
it can backfire drastically.

928
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:32,480
Whatever you've got to tell me I'll find out
through the natural course of time.

929
01:12:33,630 --> 01:12:35,440
"Dear Dr. Brown :

930
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:38,840
"On the night that I go back in time...

'Evening, Dr. Brown.
What's with the wire ?

937
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:09,200
Just a little weather experiment.

938
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:12,960
- What you got under here ?
- No ! Don't touch that !

939
01:13:13,150 --> 01:13:15,720
Some new, specialized
weather-sensing equipment.

940
01:13:15,910 --> 01:13:18,000
Got a permit for that ?

941
01:13:18,390 --> 01:13:19,910
Of course I do.

942
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:29,120
Just a second.
Let me see if I can find it here.

943
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:21,560
Do you mind if we...

944
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:24,080
park for a while ?

945
01:14:25,080 --> 01:14:27,880
That's a great idea. I'd love to park.

946
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:32,440
I'm almost 18 years old.
It's not like I've never parked before.

947
01:14:33,390 --> 01:14:34,760
What ?

948
01:14:35,150 --> 01:14:37,880
Marty, you seem so nervous.
Is something wrong ?

949
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:47,910
Lorraine, what are you doing ?

950
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:50,720
I swiped it from
the old lady's liquor cabinet.

951
01:14:50,910 --> 01:14:53,480
Yeah, well, you shouldn't drink.

952
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:55,560
- Why not ?
- Because you...

953
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:59,600
You might regret it later in life.

954
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:01,760
Marty, don't be such a square.

955
01:15:01,910 --> 01:15:04,440
Everybody who's anybody drinks.

956
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:10,560
Jeez, you smoke too ?

957
01:15:11,960 --> 01:15:14,630
You're beginning to sound
just like my mother.

958
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:28,880
<i>We're going to take a little break,
but we'll be back in a while...</i>

959
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:31,560
<i>so don't nobody go nowhere.</i>

960
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:49,800
Marty ? Why are you so nervous ?

961
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:55,120
Have you ever...

962
01:15:56,200 --> 01:15:59,800
been in a situation where you knew
you had to act a certain way, but when...

963
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,910
you got there, you didn't know
if you could go through with it ?

964
01:16:03,150 --> 01:16:06,000
You mean like how
you're supposed to act on a first date ?

965
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:08,000
Sort of.

966
01:16:08,150 --> 01:16:11,200
I think I know exactly what you mean.

967
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:13,080
You do ?

968
01:16:13,560 --> 01:16:16,000
You know what I do
in those situations ?

969
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:18,280
- What ?
- I don't worry.

970
01:16:35,480 --> 01:16:37,240
This is all wrong.

971
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:39,560
I don't know what it is...

972
01:16:40,720 --> 01:16:44,120
but when I kiss you,
it's like I'm kissing...

973
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:47,000
my brother.

974
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:49,840
I guess that doesn't make any sense,
does it ?

975
01:16:50,040 --> 01:16:51,560
Believe me...

976
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:54,000
it makes perfect sense.

977
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:56,240
Somebody's coming.

978
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:04,760
You caused $300 damage to my car,
you son of a bitch...

979
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:07,280
and I'm going to take it
out of your ass.

980
01:17:07,480 --> 01:17:08,920
Hold him.

981
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:11,560
Let him go, Biff. You're drunk.

982
01:17:12,280 --> 01:17:14,320
Well, look what we have here.

983
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:20,680
No ! Stay right here with me.
Come on, Lorraine.

984
01:17:20,920 --> 01:17:22,920
- Let me go !
- Leave her alone !

985
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:24,960
Take him in back. I'll be right there.

986
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:27,920
Just admit that you want it. Come on.

987
01:17:28,160 --> 01:17:30,520
Well, go on. This ain't no peep show.

988
01:17:36,840 --> 01:17:39,000
- Hey, let's put him in there.
- Yeah !

989
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:42,800
That's for messing up my hair.

990
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:44,920
What the hell are you doing to my car ?

991
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:47,760
Hey, beat it, spook.
This don't concern you.

992
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:52,680
Who you calling spook, peckerwood ?

993
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:55,240
Listen, guys...

994
01:17:55,400 --> 01:17:57,880
I don't want to mess
with no reefer addicts, okay ?

995
01:17:58,040 --> 01:17:59,720
Get home to your mama, boy.

996
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:01,920
- Biff !
- Hurry, Biff !

997
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:04,400
Let me out of here !

998
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,520
Reginald, where are your keys ?

999
01:18:07,680 --> 01:18:09,680
The keys are in the trunk.

1000
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:12,880
- Say that again ?
- I said, the keys are in here.

1001
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:19,120
Let me go !

1002
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:27,160
Come on !

1003
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:32,640
Hey you, get your damn hands off...

1004
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:37,160
I think you got the wrong car, McFly.

1005
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:40,760
George, help me ! Please !

1006
01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:44,240
Just turn around, McFly, and walk away.

1007
01:18:44,680 --> 01:18:46,640
- Please, George.
- Are you deaf ?

1008
01:18:46,840 --> 01:18:48,720
Close the door and beat it.

1009
01:18:51,320 --> 01:18:54,680
No, Biff. You leave her alone.

1010
01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:57,120
All right, McFly.

1011
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:02,160
You're asking for it...

1012
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:04,280
and now you're going to get it.

1013
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:06,680
Stop it !

1014
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:09,280
Biff, you'll break his arm !

1015
01:19:13,160 --> 01:19:14,920
Give me a hand here, Reginald.

1016
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:18,680
Damn it, man ! I sliced my hand !

1017
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:20,240
- Whose are these ?
- Mine.

1018
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:22,160
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

1019
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:25,640
You're going to break his arm !

1020
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:28,920
Biff ! Biff, leave him alone !

1021
01:19:29,160 --> 01:19:31,440
Let him go ! Let him go !

1022
01:20:03,080 --> 01:20:04,840
Are you okay ?

1023
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:25,800
Who is that guy ?

1024
01:20:26,160 --> 01:20:27,920
That's George McFly.

1025
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:32,800
That's George McFly ?

1026
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:34,280
Excuse me.

1027
01:20:45,160 --> 01:20:46,560
The storm.

1028
01:20:48,520 --> 01:20:51,000
Guys, you got to get back in there
and finish the dance.

1029
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:52,520
Look at Marvin's hand.

1030
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:55,640
He can't play with this hand,
and we can't play without him.

1031
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:57,240
Marvin, you got to play.

1032
01:20:57,400 --> 01:21:01,000
They kiss for the first time at the dance.
If there's no music, they can't dance.

1033
01:21:01,240 --> 01:21:04,720
If they can't dance and kiss, then
they can't fall in love and I'm history.

1034
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:08,560
The dance is over unless you know
somebody that can play the guitar.

1035
01:21:15,680 --> 01:21:17,920

George, aren't you going to kiss me ?

1040
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:35,400
I don't know.

1041
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:38,720
Scram, McFly. I'm cutting in.

Hey, boy, you all right ?

1045
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:55,840
I can't play.

1046
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:21,880
Excuse me.

01:23:06,920 --> 01:23:10,480
Yeah, man, that was good.
Let's do another one.

1056
01:23:10,680 --> 01:23:12,480
No. I got to go.

1057
01:23:12,640 --> 01:23:15,520
Come on, man.
Let's do something that really cooks.

1058
01:23:16,120 --> 01:23:18,960
Something that cooks.

1059
01:23:23,960 --> 01:23:25,920
All right. All right !

1060
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:31,080
<i>All right.</i>

1061
01:23:32,040 --> 01:23:35,160
<i>All right, this is an oldie, but...</i>

1062
01:23:37,240 --> 01:23:40,680
<i>Well, it's an oldie where I come from.</i>

1063
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:44,520
All right, listen,
this is a blues riff in B.

1064
01:23:44,680 --> 01:23:47,440
Watch me for the changes,
and try and keep up, okay ?

1065
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:06,600
<i>Way down in Louisiana

<i>There stood a log cabin
made of earth and wood</i>

<i>Where lived a country boy

Nice going.

Marty, that was very interesting music.

1085
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:29,320
I hope you don't mind, but George
asked if he could take me home.

Great ! Good, Lorraine.
I had a feeling about you two.

01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:35,840
I have a feeling, too.

1088
01:26:36,640 --> 01:26:38,360
Listen, I got to go, but...

1089
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:42,400
I wanted to tell you that
it's been educational.

1090
01:26:43,560 --> 01:26:45,600
Marty, will we ever see you again ?

1091
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:48,200
I guarantee it.

1092
01:26:48,360 --> 01:26:51,440
Well, Marty, I want to thank you
for all your good advice.

1093
01:26:51,680 --> 01:26:53,960
I'll never forget it.

1094
01:26:54,640 --> 01:26:56,080
Right, George.

1095
01:26:57,440 --> 01:27:00,680
Well, good luck, you guys.

1096
01:27:04,640 --> 01:27:06,320
One other thing.

1097
01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:08,320
If you guys ever have kids...

1098
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:10,680
and one of them,
when he's eight years old...

1099
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:13,640
accidentally sets fire
to the living room rug...

1100
01:27:15,080 --> 01:27:16,520
go easy on him.

1101
01:27:23,480 --> 01:27:26,440
Marty. Such a nice name.

1102
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:33,640
Damn ! Where is that kid ?

1103
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:38,160
Damn !

1104
01:27:49,440 --> 01:27:52,080
You're late !
Do you have no concept of time ?

1105
01:27:52,280 --> 01:27:54,480
Hey, come on. I had to change.

1106
01:27:54,640 --> 01:27:57,280
Do you think I'm going back
in that zoot suit ?

1107
01:27:57,520 --> 01:27:59,920
The old man really came through.
It worked.

1108
01:28:00,160 --> 01:28:02,080
He laid out Biff in one punch.

1109
01:28:02,240 --> 01:28:05,960
I didn't know he had it in him.
He's never stood up to Biff in his life.

1110
01:28:07,720 --> 01:28:10,920
- Never ?
- No. Why ? What's the matter ?

1111
01:28:11,640 --> 01:28:12,840
All right !

1112
01:28:13,160 --> 01:28:15,120
Let's set your destination time.

1113
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:21,920
This is the exact time you left.

1114
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:25,560
Let's send you back at exactly
the same time.

1115
01:28:28,520 --> 01:28:30,400
It'll be like you never left.

1116
01:28:32,280 --> 01:28:36,240
Now, I painted a white line
on the street way over there.

1117
01:28:36,600 --> 01:28:38,320
That's where you'll start from.

1118
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:40,560
I've calculated the precise distance...

1119
01:28:40,720 --> 01:28:43,240
taking into account
the acceleration speed...

1120
01:28:43,440 --> 01:28:47,320
and wind resistance retroactive
from the moment the lightning strikes...

1121
01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:52,030
which will be in exactly
7 minutes and 22 seconds.

1122
01:28:52,440 --> 01:28:54,680
When this alarm goes off,
you hit the gas.

1123
01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:56,030
Right.

1124
01:29:02,360 --> 01:29:05,320
Well, I guess that's everything.

1125
01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:11,600
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

1126
01:29:16,840 --> 01:29:18,640
See you in about 30 years.

1127
01:29:20,470 --> 01:29:22,030
I hope so.

1128
01:29:23,360 --> 01:29:24,840
Don't worry !

1129
01:29:25,510 --> 01:29:27,080
As long as you hit that wire...

1130
01:29:27,240 --> 01:29:30,080
with the connecting hook
at precisely 88 miles an hour...

1131
01:29:30,280 --> 01:29:32,990
the instant the lightning
strikes the tower...

1132
01:29:35,440 --> 01:29:37,470
- everything will be fine.
- Right.

1133
01:29:46,280 --> 01:29:49,680
- What's the meaning of this ?
- You'll find out in 30 years.

1134
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:51,800
It's about the future, isn't it ?

1135
01:29:51,990 --> 01:29:54,470
- Information about the future.
- Wait a minute.

1136
01:29:54,680 --> 01:29:56,470
I warned you about this, kid.

1137
01:29:56,640 --> 01:29:59,200
The consequences could be disastrous !

1138
01:29:59,440 --> 01:30:01,640
Doc, that's a risk
you're going to have to take.

1139
01:30:01,800 --> 01:30:04,760
- Your life depends on it !
- No !

1140
01:30:04,960 --> 01:30:08,030
I refuse to accept the responsibility.

1141
01:30:08,470 --> 01:30:10,920
In that case,
I'll tell you straight out.

1142
01:30:14,960 --> 01:30:16,240
Great Scott !

1143
01:30:23,920 --> 01:30:26,720
You get the cable,
I'll throw the rope down to you.

1144
01:30:26,920 --> 01:30:28,880
Right ! I got it !

1145
01:31:09,960 --> 01:31:13,720
- Come on, come on. Let's go !
- All right ! Take it up !

1146
01:31:17,160 --> 01:31:18,160
Go !

1147
01:31:27,200 --> 01:31:30,440
I have to tell you about the future.

1148
01:31:30,640 --> 01:31:34,560
- What ?
- I have to tell you about the future !

1149
01:31:34,920 --> 01:31:36,160
What ?

1150
01:31:36,280 --> 01:31:40,600
On the night
I go back in time you get...

1151
01:31:54,440 --> 01:31:55,280
Go !

1152
01:31:56,280 --> 01:31:58,360
- No, Doc !
- Look at the time !

1153
01:31:58,760 --> 01:32:00,720
You've got less than four minutes.

1154
01:32:00,920 --> 01:32:02,470
Please, hurry !

1155
01:33:06,030 --> 01:33:09,030
Damn it, Doc !
Why did you have to tear up that letter ?

1156
01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:11,080
If I only had more time.

1157
01:33:14,030 --> 01:33:16,200
Wait a minute.
I got all the time I want.

1158
01:33:16,360 --> 01:33:19,680
I got a time machine.
I can just go back early and warn him.

1159
01:33:19,920 --> 01:33:21,880
Okay. 10 minutes ought to do it.

1160
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:25,920
Okay. Time circuit's on.

1161
01:33:26,360 --> 01:33:28,800
Flux capacitor, fluxing.

1162
01:33:29,360 --> 01:33:31,280
Engine running. All right.

1163
01:33:36,470 --> 01:33:39,560
Come on. Come on. Not this time.

1164
01:34:50,440 --> 01:34:52,960
Here we go. Here we go.
This time. Come on.

1165
01:34:54,680 --> 01:34:57,320
Please. Please. Come on !

1166
01:38:05,360 --> 01:38:07,280
Crazy drunk driver.

1167
01:38:21,760 --> 01:38:23,640
All right. Fred.

1168
01:38:25,520 --> 01:38:28,000
You look great. Everything looks great.

1169
01:38:30,520 --> 01:38:33,160
I still got time. I'm coming, Doc !

1170
01:38:36,720 --> 01:38:38,920
No ! No, not again !

1171
01:38:39,120 --> 01:38:41,400
Come on ! Come on !

1172
01:38:54,560 --> 01:38:55,840
Libyans.

1173
01:39:19,800 --> 01:39:21,040
Bastards !

1174
01:39:34,040 --> 01:39:35,240
Go !

1175
01:40:31,960 --> 01:40:33,320
You're alive.

1176
01:40:42,280 --> 01:40:43,680
Bulletproof vest ?

1177
01:40:45,080 --> 01:40:46,880
How did you know ?

1178
01:40:47,400 --> 01:40:49,880
I never got a chance to tell you.

1179
01:41:02,800 --> 01:41:06,480
What about all that talk
about screwing up future events ?

1180
01:41:06,760 --> 01:41:08,560
The space-time continuum ?

1181
01:41:09,160 --> 01:41:11,800
Well, I figured, what the hell.

1182
01:41:21,760 --> 01:41:23,480
So how far ahead are you going ?

1183
01:41:23,640 --> 01:41:26,480
About 30 years.
It's a nice round number.

1184
01:41:26,680 --> 01:41:28,640
Look me up
when you get there, all right ?

1185
01:41:28,840 --> 01:41:30,760
Guess I'll be about 47.

1186
01:41:31,080 --> 01:41:32,080
I will.

1187
01:41:32,640 --> 01:41:33,640
Take care.

1188
01:41:34,800 --> 01:41:35,760
You, too.

1189
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,120
Right. Bye-bye, Einie.

1190
01:41:38,680 --> 01:41:41,320
And watch that re-entry.
It's a little bumpy.

1191
01:41:42,240 --> 01:41:43,160
You bet.

1192
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:47,160
What a nightmare.

1193
01:42:57,960 --> 01:43:01,000
If Paul calls, tell him I'm working
at the boutique late.

1194
01:43:01,200 --> 01:43:03,120
Linda, I'm not your answering service...

1195
01:43:03,280 --> 01:43:06,520
and somebody named Greg or Craig
called you just a little while ago.

1196
01:43:06,760 --> 01:43:10,480
- Which one was it ?
- I can't keep up with your boyfriends.

1197
01:43:13,080 --> 01:43:14,560
What the hell is this ?

1198
01:43:15,400 --> 01:43:16,440
Breakfast.

1199
01:43:16,960 --> 01:43:19,040
Did you sleep in your clothes again ?

1200
01:43:21,680 --> 01:43:23,840
What are you wearing, Dave ?

1201
01:43:25,880 --> 01:43:27,920
I always wear a suit to the office.

1202
01:43:28,680 --> 01:43:30,280
- You all right ?
- Yeah.

1203
01:43:31,240 --> 01:43:33,240
- We need a rematch.
- A rematch ?

1204
01:43:33,400 --> 01:43:35,400
- Why ? Were you cheating ?
- No.

1205
01:43:35,560 --> 01:43:37,160
- Hello.
- Good morning.

1206
01:43:39,320 --> 01:43:40,720
Mom ! Dad !

1207
01:43:41,160 --> 01:43:43,480
- Hit your head ?
- Are you okay ?

1208
01:43:43,680 --> 01:43:46,560
You guys look great.
Mom, you look so thin.

1209
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:49,240
Why, thank you, Marty. George !

1210
01:43:50,800 --> 01:43:52,400
Good morning, sleepyhead.

1211
01:43:53,680 --> 01:43:56,200
- Good morning, kids.
- 'Morning.

1212
01:43:56,440 --> 01:43:58,760
Marty, I almost forgot.
Jennifer Parker called.

1213
01:43:58,920 --> 01:44:02,240
I sure like her.
She is such a sweet girl.

1214
01:44:02,880 --> 01:44:04,840
Isn't tonight
the night of the big date ?

1215
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:06,680
What ? What, Ma ?

1216
01:44:06,840 --> 01:44:10,520
Aren't you going up to the lake ?
You've been planning it for two weeks.

1217
01:44:10,880 --> 01:44:13,200
We talked about this.
How can I go to the lake ?

1218
01:44:13,520 --> 01:44:14,560
The car's wrecked.

1219
01:44:14,680 --> 01:44:16,080
- Wrecked ?
- Wrecked ?

1220
01:44:16,320 --> 01:44:18,320
- When did this happen ?
- Why wasn't I told ?

1221
01:44:18,480 --> 01:44:21,800
- I'm sure the car is fine.
- Why am I the last to know ?

1222
01:44:22,240 --> 01:44:24,880
See ? There's Biff out there
waxing it now.

1223
01:44:25,640 --> 01:44:29,640
Now, Biff, I want to make sure we get
two coats of wax, not just one.

1224
01:44:29,880 --> 01:44:33,680
- I'm just finishing up the 2d coat now.
- Now, Biff, don't con me.

1225
01:44:35,440 --> 01:44:37,200
I'm sorry, Mr. McFly.

1226
01:44:37,440 --> 01:44:40,080
I meant I was just starting
on the second coat.

1227
01:44:40,880 --> 01:44:42,920
Biff. What a character.

1228
01:44:43,200 --> 01:44:45,400
Always trying to get away
with something.

1229
01:44:45,600 --> 01:44:48,360
I've had to stay on top of Biff
ever since high school.

1230
01:44:48,560 --> 01:44:52,280
- But, if it wasn't for him...
- We'd never have fallen in love.

1231
01:44:54,160 --> 01:44:56,520
Mr. McFly !
Mr. McFly, this just arrived.

1232
01:44:56,760 --> 01:44:59,200
Hi, Marty. I think it's your new book.

1233
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,160
Honey ! Your first novel.

1234
01:45:05,720 --> 01:45:10,400
I've always told you, if you put your
mind to it, you can accomplish anything.

1235
01:45:10,760 --> 01:45:14,080
Marty, here's your keys.
You're all waxed up, ready for tonight.

1236
01:45:14,480 --> 01:45:15,360
Keys ?

1237
01:45:31,240 --> 01:45:33,480
- How about a ride, mister ?
- Jennifer !

1238
01:45:35,200 --> 01:45:37,000
Are you a sight for sore eyes.

1239
01:45:37,400 --> 01:45:39,000
Let me look at you.

1240
01:45:39,520 --> 01:45:42,160
Marty, you're acting like
you haven't seen me in a week.

1241
01:45:42,360 --> 01:45:43,400
I haven't.

1242
01:45:44,280 --> 01:45:45,320
You okay ?

1243
01:45:46,200 --> 01:45:47,880
Is everything all right ?

1244
01:45:53,800 --> 01:45:55,320
Everything is great.

1245
01:46:11,440 --> 01:46:13,320
You've got to come back with me !

1246
01:46:14,040 --> 01:46:16,120
- Where ?
- Back to the future.

1247
01:46:20,760 --> 01:46:22,440
What are you doing, Doc ?

1248
01:46:23,840 --> 01:46:24,960
I need fuel.

1249
01:46:28,160 --> 01:46:30,120
Go ahead. Quick ! Get in the car.

1250
01:46:30,520 --> 01:46:34,640
No. I just got here. Jennifer's here.
We're taking the new truck for a spin.

1251
01:46:34,920 --> 01:46:37,560
Bring her along. This concerns her, too.

1252
01:46:37,800 --> 01:46:41,000
What are you talking about ?
What happens to us in the future ?

1253
01:46:41,440 --> 01:46:44,160
- Do we become assholes or something ?
- No, Marty.

1254
01:46:44,360 --> 01:46:47,440
Both you and Jennifer turn out fine.
It's your kids, Marty.

1255
01:46:47,640 --> 01:46:49,680
Something has got to be done
about your kids.

1256
01:46:55,880 --> 01:46:58,680
We better back up. We don't have
enough road to get up to 88.

1257
01:46:58,920 --> 01:47:02,240
Roads ? Where we're going,
we don't need roads.

1258
01:47:03,305 --> 01:47:09,173
